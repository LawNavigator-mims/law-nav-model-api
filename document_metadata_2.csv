CALAVERAS COUNTY, CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL CODE ____________ A Codification of the General Ordinances of the County of Calaveras, California ____________ Beginning with Supp. No. 7, Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation ____________ PREFACE The Calaveras County Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1979, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Jeffrey Tuttle, deputy county attorney. The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 7, legislation can be tracked using the ""Code Comparative Table and Disposition List."" A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ord. No. 3204, passed June 11, 2024. Municipal Code Corporation 1700 Capital Circle SW Tallahassee, FL 32310 800-262-2633 HOW TO USE YOUR CODE This code is organized to make the laws of the county as accessible as possible to county officials, county employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. Numbering System. The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. Title. A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. Chapter. Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, a Chapter 2.06, County Manager, can be added between 2.04, County Councel, and Chapter 2.08, County Attorney. Section. Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by ""tens"" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. Tables of Contents. There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. Ordinance History Note. At the end of each code section, you will find an ""ordinance history note,"" which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) Beginning with Supplement No. 7 a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. Statutory References. The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. Cross-Reference Table. When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or ""prior"" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider ""Tables."" This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled ""Prior Code Section"" and the new code section in the column labeled ""Herein."" As of Supplement No. 7, this table will no longer be updated. Ordinance List and Disposition Table. To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called ""Tables"" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be ""(Special)."" If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be ""(Not codified)."" Other dispositions sometimes used are ""(Tabled),"" ""(Pending),"" ""(Number Not Used)"" or ""(Missing)."" Beginning with Supplement No. 7 this table will be replaced with the ""Code Comparative Table and Disposition List."" Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. Beginning with Supplement No. 7, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. Index. If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: BUSINESS LICENSE See also BUSINESS TAX Fee 5.04.030 Required when 5.04.010 The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. Instruction Sheet. Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. Page Numbers. When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 7, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a ""Point Numbering System"". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be ""reserved"" for later use. Electronic Submission. In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

A. The county shall require a post-offer, pre-employment medical exam of every person appointed to a permanent position in county service in accord with the guidelines established by the Americans With Disabilities Act and other pertinent legislation. Such a medical exam shall be given by the county health officer at no charge to the employee, or the physician of choice, at the employee's expense. B. County employees applying for change of position with more exacting physical requirements may be required to undergo a physical examination for the new job classification as a condition to any such change of position, after such an offer of employment in the new classification is made. C. A person being considered for employment (or for transfer to a position with more exacting physical requirements) who does not pass the physical examination may be determined exempt by the CAO when it is shown that the person possesses the necessary knowledge, skills, abilities and qualifications and can perform the essential job functions with or without reasonable accommodation. The CAO may, at his/her discretion, exempt other persons under certain circumstances if such exemption is deemed to be in the best interest of the county. D. It is the duty of the county health officer to give priority in scheduling physical examinations to persons requiring an exam pursuant to this section. E. Any employee may be required to take a physical examination given by the county health officer or other designated physician when the appointing authority and/or CAO believes that the employee may suffer from illness, injury or some condition which is seriously affecting the employee's health, safety, attendance or ability to perform the responsibilities of the position, or the health and safety of others. F. Where a permanent employee fails to pass a physical examination given pursuant to subsection E of this section, the appointing authority may request that the health officer provide additional information and/or conduct, or request to be conducted, at county expense, additional physical examinations necessary to enable the appointing authority and/or CAO to determine the employee's eligibility to perform the assigned duties of his or her position. The examining physician, in conjunction with the appointing authority and CAO, shall attempt to determine the following: 1. Whether the employee is unfit to perform the essential functions of the position; 2. Whether reasonable accommodation may be made; 3. Whether the employee is capable of performing other duties in county service and, if so, the types of positions or duties which the employee could perform in accordance with law, adopted standards, with or without reasonable accommodation; 4. Whether the employee is permanently unable to perform his or her duties; 5. Whether the incapacity is a result of injury or disease arising out of, or in the course of, employment; 6. Whether the incapacity may pose substantial risk to the safety of the employee or others; 7. Whether the incapacity may become progressively worse. G. If an employee who has failed a physical examination is determined fit to perform the duties of his or her position, the appointing authority may require that such employee take additional physical examinations at periodic intervals to assure that the employee continues to remain fit to perform the duties of his or her position. H. If an employee is determined unfit to perform the duties of his or her position but capable of performing other duties in county service, the appointing authority and the county personnel officer shall immediately attempt to transfer or demote that employee to a vacant position in the same department or within the county service with duties appropriate to his or her capacity. If no change of position is obtained within a reasonable period as determined by the appointing authority and the CAO, the employee may, if eligible, elect to retire or resign from the county service. If the employee fails to elect to retire or resign, the appointing authority may elect to terminate the employee. I. The employee shall be given written notice of demotion, transfer or termination under this section at least five calendar days prior to the effective date thereof. The employee may appeal the action of the appointing authority pursuant to appeals procedures provided in this chapter. J. Upon the request of an appointing authority or the petition of an employee terminated, demoted or transferred in accordance with this section, the employee may be reinstated to an appropriate position in the same class, in a comparable class or in a lower related class if it is determined by the board of supervisors that the employee is no longer incapacitated. Such reinstatement to a position in a different department may be made only with the concurrence of that department's appointing authority. In approving or ordering such reinstatements, the board of supervisors may require the satisfactory completion of a new probationary period. When the board of supervisors finds that an employee is no longer incapacitated but there is no vacant position to which he or she appropriately can be appointed, the name of that employee shall be placed upon reemployment lists determined appropriate by the CAO. K. Any employee who is a member of the retirement system who is permanently incapacitated for the performance of duty may be retired for disability, regardless of age, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

A. Policy. It is the policy of the board that overtime work is discouraged; that each appointing authority is to arrange the work of the department so that employees shall work not more than the standard departmental workweek; that overtime work be held to a minimum, consistent with the efficient performance of necessary functions; and that overtime work be used only for emergencies or when temporarily using regular employees on an overtime basis can be shown to be more economical than using extra help.

Leaves of absence for more than a total of one hundred twenty calendar days must be approved by the board of supervisors. A leave of absence without pay may be requested for reasons which in the opinion of the authorizing authority are justifiable, are beneficial to the county and the employee involved, and which will not create hardship in the department concerned. Leave of absence requests shall be initiated in writing by the employee, stating the reasons for the request, the proposed beginning date of the leave, and the proposed date of return. B. A copy of any request for a leave of absence without pay shall be delivered promptly to the CAO and the county auditor-controller. C. A leave of absence without pay may be for a period of up to one year, and the board may extend such leave for an additional period of up to one year (up to two years total). Procedure in granting extensions shall be the same as that in granting the original leave, provided that the request for extension must be made at least three weeks before the end of the original leave unless otherwise provided by resolution of the board of supervisors. D. The granting of any leave of absence without pay may cause the employee's anniversary date to be postponed by the number of payroll periods equal to the number of payroll periods for which leave is granted. E. Whenever an employee who has been granted a leave of absence without pay desires to return before the expiration of that leave, the employee shall notify the department head three weeks in advance of the anticipated date of return; the department head shall give the employee temporarily filling the position at least two weeks' notice of termination. F. Leaves of absence without pay for a department head shall be granted only by the board of supervisors, for such periods as the board may deem appropriate. G. Any employee who fails to return at the expiration of an approved leave of absence shall be considered automatically to have resigned. Such person may appeal all determinations to the CAO within four days of the end of leave of absence. H. Benefits During Leave Without Pay. 1. Vacation and sick leave do not accrue during leave without pay; 2.

A. Whenever any county employee is directed by a licensed physician to be absent from duty due to illness or injury arising out of, and in the course of, employment, the employee shall receive full compensation for the scheduled work days falling within the first three days of such absence, provided a written statement from the attending physician is submitted to his or her department head and transmitted to the auditor-controller. Failure to provide such statement shall cause the absence to be charged against accrued sick leave or as leave without pay. Any reimbursement under the Workers' Compensation Act for the first three days of disability shall be paid to the county. Thereafter during such absence, employees may elect either to freeze their accrued paid leave, receiving only workers' compensation disability pay; or to apply prorated accrued sick leave, earned vacation and earned compensatory time credits to such absence in addition to such workers' compensation benefits received so as to receive his or her regular county pay, not to exceed the amount of accrued sick leave and earned compensatory time credits. B. Unless the employee notifies the CAO and the county auditor-controller to the contrary, it will be presumed that the employee is electing to prorate his or her accrued sick leave and earned vacation and earned compensatory time credits so as to receive full salary. In prorating, the charge to the employee's accrued sick leave, earned vacation credits or earned compensatory time credits shall be to the nearest quarter of an hour. Prorating may be accomplished by the employee signing over to the auditor-controller workers' compensation disability payments (received from the Workers' Compensation Administration), if deemed appropriate. C. Whenever practicable, an employee injured on the job shall report the injury immediately to his or her department head. In no event shall such notification be delayed beyond twenty-four hours. The department head must notify the administrative office immediately and must then complete any required report and deliver it to the CAO. D. Employees who need medical attention for a job-related injury or illness and who expect reimbursement for the costs of treatment must be directed to and attended by physicians designated under the Employer's Self-Insurance System (Workers' Compensation) for the initial visit or to the appropriate hospital emergency room when those physicians are unavailable.

Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter: A. ""Hotel"" means any structure or any portion of any structure which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.

""Operator"" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. D. ""Rent"" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

""Transient"" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, countng portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered.

For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel in the unincorporated area of the county, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of twelve percent of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the county which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the county. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax is due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. Revenue generated by this tax shall be used for unrestricted general revenue purposes to maintain or improve essential county services and infrastructure, including but not limited to Sheriff's patrols, emergency fire district response and protection, road and pothole repairs, traffic flow and safety improvements, attracting and retaining businesses, and reinvestment in economic development.

At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return.

In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address.

A. As Calaveras County is the operator of the county's public transit system, the county board of supervisors is responsible for determining Calaveras Transit policies. The purpose of this chapter is to establish guidelines for interior and exterior advertising on Calaveras Transit vehicles and shelters. The board intends its vehicles and bus shelters are subject to the viewpoint-neutral restrictions set forth below. B. The county has approved the practice of commercial advertising on the exterior and interior of its vehicles, as well as on bus shelters, as a means of raising revenue for the transit system. Revenue generated from advertising is returned to the transit operating budget and used to reduce local contributions to fund operations. C. Calaveras Transit may use exterior and interior vehicle advertising itself to promote public awareness of transit programs and services. D. The ordinance codified in this chapter repeals and supersedes Resolution No. 20150113001, except that the fee schedule approved by Resolution No. 20150113001 shall remain in effect until changed by the board of supervisors. E. The board of supervisors designates the director of public works to implement the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. No. 3056, § I, 7-14-2015) ",Calaveras_County,121,Calaveras_County.pdf,251

A. Each fire district or, in the case of the Angels Camp Fire Department the City of Angels Camp, shall by June 1 each year produce a response improvement plan and budget detailing how it will use the revenue from the Calaveras Local Fire Protection Tax in the coming fiscal year beginning July 1. These plans will be submitted to the Calaveras County Fire Services Joint Powers Authority. Also, each fire agency will each year provide the JPA with a copy of its annual audit and management report. The JPA will use the plans and audits each year to prepare a summary of the countywide improvements funded by the Calaveras County Local Fire Protection Tax. The JPA will issue this summary and a news release to media outlets, provide copies to the Calaveras county Grand Jury and Board of Supervisors and also post it online. B. Plans may include a provision to retain up to ten percent of funds received as a cash carryover. Such cash carryovers are to be retained by the agencies as a way to maintain service levels in future years when revenue declines. Such carryover funds may be used only for purposes specified in this measure. C. If any agency or agencies choose either temporarily or permanently to not receive Calaveras Local Fire Protection Tax funding, then the allocation formula shall be changed to show that the first sixty-nine percent of funding is divided evenly among the remaining agencies, that one percent shall be allocated to San Andreas Fire Protection District to compensate for protecting county infrastructure, and the remaining thirty percent shall be divided among the remaining agencies according to population. If San Andreas is among the agencies choosing to not receive funding, then the formula shall be seventy percent divided evenly and thirty percent divided by population for the remaining agencies. D. Any portion of an agency's Calaveras Local Fire Protection Tax funding that is not either spent on a budgeted purpose or retained as a cash carryover shall be returned to the Calaveras Local Fire Protection Account and included in funds available for allocation and distribution in the following fiscal year. In years with revenue growth such that receipts exceed one hundred and ten percent of the estimated amounts on which fire agencies based their budgets, then the amount in excess of one hundred and ten percent shall be retained in the Calaveras Local Fire Protection Account and made available for allocation and distribution in the next fiscal year. E. Revenue from the Calaveras Local Fire Protection Tax in any given year that is between one hundred percent and one hundred and ten percent of the estimated revenue used as the basis for agency Calaveras Local Fire Protection Tax budgets may at the discretion of those agencies either be retained as cash carryover for use in future years or returned to the Calaveras Local Fire Protection Account for distribution in the coming fiscal year. In either case, all funds shall be used only as specified in approved Calaveras Local Fire Protection Tax budgets. (F) Each year by May 1, the Calaveras County auditor's office shall provide the fire agencies with an estimate of revenue available to those agencies in the coming fiscal year that will begin on July 1, based both on funds carried over in the Calaveras Local Fire Protection Account and on actual sales tax receipts in the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.

A. The CATV system shall be installed and maintained in accordance with the highest and best accepted standards of the CATV industry, to the effect that subscribers shall receive the highest quality service technically possible. B. In determining the satisfactory extent of such standards, the following, among others, shall be considered as minimum requirements. 1. The CATV system shall be installed using all band equipment capable of passing the entire VHF television and FM broadcast spectrum (i.e., no less than 50 to 220 megahertz, including the so-called ""mid-band"" region) and, further, it shall have the capability of converting the UHF television broadcasting range to channels between 50 and 220 megahertz for distribution to subscribers. 2. Signals shall be transmitted from the antenna origination point to all subscribers tap-off points, regardless of location on the distribution portion of the system, without the introduction of any noticeable degradation of color fidelity, picture intelligence or audio distortion. 3. Color phase shift introduced by system components between the off-the-air receiving antennas and the customer tap-off point shall not exceed two degrees under any circumstances, on a cumulative basis. 4. The system and all equipment in the system shall be rated for continuous twenty-four hour per day operation. 5. The system shall provide a signal level of not less than two thousand microvolts, as measured across seventy-two ohms at the subscriber's television receiver, on the highest channel (by frequency) carried on the system to all color television receivers connected to the system. No channel shall exceed the highest and lowest values for the highest and lowest channels by more than .5 decibels for more than fifty percent of the time. 6. The system shall provide equivalent service levels of not less than one thousand five hundred microvolts on the highes and not less than one thousand microvolts on the lowest channel, both as measured across the seventy-two-ohm drop all black and white receivers connected to the system. 7. The system shall provide a minimum signal of not less two hundred microvolts on the lowest intensity FM channel (as measured at the customer service drop termination point) delivered, and a maximum signal intensity of not more than three decibels greater level than the lowest intensity FM channel delivered by the cable (i.e., all FM channels carried by the system shall be flat to within three decibels of the lowest and highest FM channels carried, and the lowest of these shall be not lower than two hundred microvolts across seventy-two ohms). 8. The system design and operation shall exhibit a signal plus noise to noise ratio of not less than forty decibels, as measured at the extremities of all trunk and customer distribution lines covering the franchise area. 9. Hum modulation of the picture (video) carrier shall not exceed five percent at any point in the system. 10. All active components in the system shall have a VSWR not to exceed 1.5 to 1; all passive devices in the system shall have input, output and return losses of not less than twenty decibels. 11. The system shall maintain a minimum video carrier to aural carrier ratio of fifteen decibels and a maximum video carrier to aural carrier ratio of eighteen decibels for all television channels. This video carrier to aural carrier relationship shall be established in such a manner that the color subcarrier, if present, to video carrier relationship shall not be degraded below its as-received off-the-air ratio by more than .25 decibels. 12. Carriage of so-called local channels shall be accomplished in such a way that these channels, as delivered to the system subscribers, if delivered on-channel, shall be at least forty decibels stronger, as measured at the customer receiver tuner input terminals, than any stray direct pickup from these channels. If this is not possible, channel conversion of these stations shall be made to utilize other regular VHF channels, mid-band or octave channels for the delivery of these stations to the customers' receivers. 13. The system shall be designed in such a way that twelve-channel operation is possible at the outset, and that all parts replaced after March 31, 1982, shall have the capability of carrying twenty or more channels, utilizing either mid-band or super-band frequencies or octave frequency groupings. a. If so-called mid-band or super-band frequencies for cable carriage of one or more channels are utilized, it shall be demonstrated that such carriage is possible in the county without introduction into the cable transmission lines of direct pick from radio services operating in the mid-band or super-band region, which would tend to interfere with the carriage of one or more proposed television channels in this frequency range. b. If the octave-frequency grouping method of providing spectrum space for additional channels (more than twelve regular VHF channels) is utilized, it shall be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the chief administrative officer that such equipment is operational and available for delivery.

A. Purpose. This chapter is intended to be applicable to state franchise holders who have been awarded a state video franchise under Division 2.5 (commencing with Section 5800) of the Public Utilities Code (the ""Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006"" or ""DIVCA""), to serve any location(s) within the unincorporated areas of the county. It is the purpose of this chapter to implement within the unincorporated areas of the county the provisions of DIVCA and the rules of the California Public Utilities Commission promulgated thereunder that are applicable to a ""local franchising entity"" or a ""local entity"" as defined in DIVCA. B. Rights Reserved. 1. The rights reserved to the county under this chapter are in addition to all other rights of the county, whether reserved by this chapter or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right shall affect any other rights which may be held by the county. 2. Except as otherwise provided by DIVCA, a state franchise shall not include, or be a substitute for: a. Compliance with applicable requirements for the privilege of transacting and carrying on a business within the county, including, but not limited to, compliance with the conditions that the county may establish before facilities may be constructed for, or providing, non-video services; b. Any permit or authorization required in connection with operations on or in public rights-of-way or public property, including, but not limited to, encroachment permits, street work permits, pole attachment permits and street cut permits; and c. Any permit, agreement or authorization for occupying any other property of the county or any private person to which access is not specifically granted by the state franchise. 3. No permit issued by the county to a state franchise holder is itself a franchise, nor shall any permit create a vested right that would prohibit the county from revoking or amending the permit. C. Compliance with Calaveras County Code and Ordinances. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to exempt a state franchise holder from compliance with all codes, ordinances, rules or regulations of the county now in effect or which may be hereafter adopted which are consistent with this chapter or California Public Utilities Code section 5800 et seq., or any obligations under any franchise issued by the county insofar as those obligations may be enforced under California Public Utilities Code § 5800 et seq. D. Compliance with DIVCA. When a video service provider holding a state franchise provides notice to the county pursuant to 5840(m) of DIVCA that it is commencing to provide video service to the county, a holder of a county franchises shall seek a state franchise pursuant to 5930(c) of DIVCA, and upon issuance of the state franchise by the California Public Utilities Commission for the franchise area, the county franchise shall terminate.

To the extent feasible, the PEG channels shall not be separated numerically from other channels carried on the lowest cost tier of service and the channel numbers for the PEG channels shall be the same channel numbers used by any incumbent cable operator, unless prohibited by federal law.

If no technically feasible point of interconnection is available, each state franchise holder shall make interconnection available to each PEG channel originator programming a channel in the county and shall provide the facilities necessary for the interconnection. The cost of any interconnection shall be borne by each state franchise holder requesting the interconnection unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. (Ord.

Conditions constituting a nuisance under this section include: 1. Excessive dust; 2. Excessive noise; 3. Excessive odors; 4. Vectors; 5. Threat to health. B. Any dog which has been allowed or permitted to persistently and chronically violate this section, including the conditions set forth in subsection A, as demonstrated by one or more convictions for violating this section, and the receipt of subsequent complaints from more than one household, is declared to be a public nuisance and may be impounded upon compliance with the procedures outlined in subsections C through I. C. Whenever any chronic barking dog nuisance as defined in subsection B of this section is found on any premises within the jurisdiction of the county, a written notice shall be given to the owner, possessor or keeper of the dog, or to the owner, occupant, person in possession, person in charge or person in control of the premises where the dog is located, or a written notice shall be posted at such premises when none of the above people can be found at the premises. Such notice shall be signed by the director of the animal services or his or her authorized representative and shall give the person or persons to whom it is directed no less than seventy-two hours (three days) nor more than one hundred twenty hours (five days) to abate the chronic barking dog nuisance. Such notice shall also state that the dog may be impounded if the barking dog nuisance is not abated. D. If, after the time given to comply with the notice has passed, the barking dog nuisance has not been abated, the director of the animal services or designee may: summarily abate the barking dog nuisance by impounding the barking dog; assess the costs of such abatement against the owner, possessor or keeper of the dog, or to the owner, occupant, person in possession, person in charge or person in control of the premises where the dog is located, to be collected by suit or otherwise; and issue a citation for the violation of this section. The impoundment shall continue until the resolution of the citation issued in conjunction with the impoundment or, until the director or a hearing officer has conducted the administrative hearing described in this section and determined that the dog does not constitute a barking dog nuisance and should be released. E. At the time any dog is impounded as a barking dog nuisance, the director or their designee shall serve a notice on the owner, possessor or keeper of the dog, or to the owner, occupant, person in possession, person in charge or person in control of the premises where the dog is located; or a written notice shall be posted at such premises when none of the above people can be found at the premises. Such notice shall be signed by the director of the animal services or his or her authorized representative. Such notice shall state that the dog has been impounded as a chronic barking dog nuisance under this section; that the owners, possessors, and keepers of the dog are entitled to a hearing to contest the impoundment; that to obtain such a hearing, the owner, possessor, or keeper must submit a written petition for release of the dog, containing the petitioner's name and address, including mailing address, and the reason the dog should not be classified as a chronic barking dog nuisance; and that this petition must be filed with the director within seven business days of the impoundment. If the last day of this seven-day period falls on a non business day or holiday, the time for filing the petition shall be extended to the next regular business day. F. When a dog has been impounded pursuant to this section, and the owner, possessor or keeper of such dog disputes the classification of such dog as a chronic barking dog nuisance, the owner, possessor or keeper of such dog may file a written petition for a hearing concerning such classification with the director no later than seven business days after impoundment. If the last day of this seven-day period falls on a non business day or holiday, the time for filing the petition shall be extended to the next regular business day. Such petition shall include the petitioner's name and address, including mailing address and the reason the petitioner believes the dog should not be classified as a chronic barking dog nuisance. The petition shall be set for a hearing to be held on a date no more than thirty days after the date the petition is filed. The director, or the director's designee, shall issue a notice of the hearing date by mailing a copy to the petitioner's address no later than ten days prior to the date of the hearing. The director, or the director's designee, shall post a public notice of the hearing for a minimum of two weeks prior to the hearing date. Where the owners, possessors, or keepers of the dog fail to file a written petition with the director within seven days of the impoundment, excluding non business days and holidays, they shall be deemed to have waived their right to a hearing to contest the classification of the dog as a chronic barking dog nuisance. G. The hearing on the chronic barking dog classification shall be held before the director or a hearing officer designated by the director. The sole issue at the hearing shall be whether the dog constitutes a chronic barking dog nuisance as defined in subsection B of this section. The hearing shall not address the sufficiency of abatement or any other issues. H. If the hearing officer determines the dog does constitute a chronic barking dog nuisance as defined in subsection B of this section, the hearing officer shall make a determination to the disposition of the offending dog and remand custody of the offending dog to the director of animal services for re-homing or humane destruction. The owners, possessors, or keepers of the dog shall be responsible for all cost associated with the impoundment and housing of the animal until the time the animal is remanded to the custody of the director.

The owner of the dog shall be notified that a hearing will be held by the superior court at which time such owner may present evidence as to why the dog should not be declared potentially dangerous or vicious. The owner of the dog shall be served with notice of the hearing and a copy of the petition, either personally or by first-class mail with return receipt requested. The hearing shall be held promptly within no less than five working days nor more than ten working days after service of notice upon the owner of the dog. The hearing shall be open to the public.

Post a notice on site that the premises are unsafe, substandard, or dangerous; 3. Board, fence, or secure the building or site; 4. Raze and grade the immediately hazardous portion of the building or site to prevent further collapse and remove the hazard to the general public; 5.

A. The building official shall pursue only the minimum level of correction or abatement necessary to correct or eliminate the immediate threat or hazard. Costs incurred by the county during the summary abatement process shall be assessed, collected, and recovered against the owner or occupant through the procedures outlined in this chapter. As soon as is practicable, the building official shall notify the supervisor for the district in which the hazardous property or conditions requiring immediate correction(s) or elimination is located. B. Summary Abatement Notice. If the building official decides that a summary abatement is necessary, he or she shall provide the owner and occupant written notice of the nuisance requiring correction or elimination by posting conspicuous written notice on the property at or prior to the time of summary abatement. Such posting shall constitute sufficient notice. If an owner or occupant is present and refuses to allow the building official or his/her designee to post notice, or if the owner or occupant does not or is unable to immediately correct or eliminate the immediate threat(s) or hazard(s) after notice of summary abatement is posted on the property, the county may abate the nuisance to the extent necessary to correct or eliminate the immediate threat(s) or hazard(s). C. Post-Abatement Notice. After the summary correction or abatement is completed, the building official shall within five business days serve the owner and occupant in the manner described in Section 8.06.400 with a post-abatement notice that states: 1. The actions taken by the county and the reasons for the actions; 2. The right to contest the necessity for summary abatement and/or costs by appealing within fifteen days of receiving the post-abatement notice; 3. A statement describing the costs of the summary abatement plus notice of the county's intent to collect those costs; 4. The procedures available to appeal the summary abatement and/or costs to the administrative hearing board or administrative hearing officer. D. Appeals concerning summary abatement and/or costs shall be heard by the administrative hearing board or administrative hearing officer pursuant to Sections 8.06.600 and 8.06.700. E. The building official may also pursue any other administrative or judicial remedy to abate any remaining violation or public nuisance. (Ord.

Title 8 - HEALTH AND SAFETY,Chapter 8.06 - PROPERTY MAINTENANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES,8.06.600 - Administrative hearing board hearings and procedures.,"Calaveras_County | Title 8 - HEALTH AND SAFETY | Chapter 8.06 - PROPERTY MAINTENANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES | 8.06.600 - Administrative hearing board hearings and procedures.
A. If any administrative citation and order is appealed, that does not concern cannabis cultivation on the subject property and does not involve a summary abatement, the initial hearing required by subdivision (a) of Section 25845 of the Government Code is hereby delegated to a hearing board designated by the board of supervisors. The board of supervisors delegates its authority to the hearing board, which shall be known as the administrative hearing board (""AHB""), pursuant to Government Code Section 25845(h). The board of supervisors hereby designates the Calaveras County Planning Commission to be the administrative hearing board for the purposes of this section. All hearings of the AHB shall be scheduled to occur at the conclusion of regularly-scheduled planning commission meetings, at which time the planning commission shall reconvene as the AHB. B. The mailing and physical address of the AHB shall be: Administrative Hearing Board, c/o Calaveras County Code Compliance Unit, 891 Mountain Ranch Road, San Andreas, California, 95249. C. Pursuant to Government Code Section 25845, upon timely written request of an owner or occupant who wishes to appeal the issuance of an administrative citation and order and/or fines pursuant to Section 8.06.420 which are unrelated to cannabis cultivation on the subject property, the AHB shall hold an administrative hearing to determine whether the conditions existing on the property constitute a nuisance under this chapter, or whether there is any other good cause why those conditions should not be abated or why the fines levied should be reduced. This hearing shall be held no less than ten days after mailing of the notice of hearing, and no more than ninety days after the AHB's receipt of the written request for hearing. If an administrative citation and order is not appealed and the administrative process not exhausted, the violation(s) and any fines will be considered to be upheld, and the building official or his/her designee will seek authorization from the board of supervisors to abate any continuing violations and impose a lien for recovery of costs. D. The AHB shall have the power to conduct administrative hearings, the power to make findings of fact and conclusions of law required for its recommendation, the power to receive evidence and to make findings as to its admissibility, and the power to make recommendations to the board of supervisors regarding fines and abatement orders and that the cost of the abatement be specially assessed against the parcel. E. An owner or occupant may also request an administrative hearing to challenge a summary abatement and/or the costs of the same pursuant to Section 8.06.570(D). Nothing in this section prohibits the summary abatement of a nuisance in the event of an immediate threat to public health or safety as determined by the building official or his or her designee. F. Hearing Procedures. 1. Administrative hearings are intended to be informal in nature. Formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply. The administrative hearing board may question witnesses at any time and recall them as necessary for further testimony. All participants, including parties, counsel, and witnesses, will be expected to maintain a civil demeanor and to present only relevant evidence. The AHB is not required to accept into the record evidence that is irrelevant to the matter before it. The AHB may adopt more specific rules of procedure to govern its hearing process so long as those rules comply with the county code. 2. Those owner(s) or occupant(s) who filed a timely request to appeal shall be given an opportunity at the hearing to present and elicit testimony or other evidence regarding whether the conditions existing on the property constitute a nuisance under this chapter, or whether there is any other good cause why those conditions should not be abated. An attorney authorized to practice law in the state of California may represent appellants so long as that attorney has been retained by and is attorney of record for that appellant for purposes of the appeal hearing. 3. In the event that the appellant(s) or his or her attorney retained to represent him or her at that hearing does not appear and present evidence at the hearing, the administrative hearing board may base its findings and decision solely upon the evidence submitted by the building official or his/her designee. Failure of the appellant or his or her retained attorney to appear and present evidence at the hearing shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The AHB is not required to grant requests for continuances but may do so at its own discretion upon a party's request. 4. The AHB shall consider the matter de novo, and may affirm, reverse, or modify the determinations contained in the citation. 5. The AHB may at its discretion consolidate and hear at once all timely-filed appeals of an administrative citation and order submitted by multiple individuals or entities with a lawful ownership or possessory interest in the subject property. G. Post-Hearing Procedures. At the conclusion of the hearing, the administrative hearing board shall issue a written recommendation, which may include findings relating to the existence or nonexistence of the alleged violation(s), as well as any findings concerning the propriety and means of abatement of the conditions set forth in the citation and order; findings of fact on material issues and the grounds therefore; related conclusions of law or policy; any aggravating or mitigating circumstances pertinent to the decision; recommended costs, fines, and penalties; and, if requested by the building official or his/her designee, a recommendation that the county abate the nuisance and for the cost of the abatement to be specially assessed against the parcel. Such written recommendations and findings shall be mailed to, or personally served upon, the party requesting the hearing, any other parties upon whom the administrative citation and order was served, and the building official. If an appellant was represented by counsel at the hearing, then a copy of the recommendation shall be mailed to or personally served upon his/her counsel in lieu of being delivered or mailed to the represented party. If the AHB recommends substantial changes to the recommendations and/or findings proposed and submitted by the building official, it may continue the hearing as necessary to allow adequate time to amend the recommendations or findings. H. Recommendations of the Administrative Hearing Board. 1. The written recommendation of the AHB shall be submitted by the building official to the clerk of the board of supervisors within fourteen days of the hearing, to be placed on the board of supervisors' agenda for a regularly- scheduled board meeting. The clerk of the AHB shall mail notice to any party who appealed the administrative citation at least ten days before the board meeting for which the AHB's recommendation has been placed on the agenda. 2. The board of supervisors shall either adopt the recommendation of the AHB by majority vote without hearing, or may, at its sole discretion, hold a de novo hearing on the merits beginning that same day. Failure of the owner or occupant to have appeared and presented evidence to the AHB shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and no de novo hearing shall be held. The decision of the board of supervisors, including any authorization to abate continuing violations and to impose an assessment lien for costs of abatement, shall constitute the final administrative decision or order. All final administrative decisions or orders ratified by the board of supervisors may be appealed pursuant to Government Code Section 53069.4 or Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5. (Ord.

Title 8 - HEALTH AND SAFETY,Chapter 8.06 - PROPERTY MAINTENANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES,"8.06.700 - Alternative notice of violation, citation, and appeal procedure for violations related to cannabis cultivation on a property;","Calaveras_County | Title 8 - HEALTH AND SAFETY | Chapter 8.06 - PROPERTY MAINTENANCE AND ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES | 8.06.700 - Alternative notice of violation, citation, and appeal procedure for violations related to cannabis cultivation on a property;
establishment of o ce of county hearing o cer. A. Because cannabis cultivation in violation of county code is a public nuisance with unique impacts and a need for time- sensitive abatement in order to render local regulations meaningful, the purpose and intent of this section is to allow code enforcement to more quickly and effectively control the adverse impacts associated with unlawful cannabis cultivation. Ordinary abatement provisions of this chapter provide lengthy timeframes for appeal and abatement and require that every appeal be heard by the AHB, and, upon further appeal, by the board of supervisors, before an order for abatement may issue. A more streamlined appeal schedule and enforcement scheme is necessary and proper for cases involving unlawful cannabis cultivation because such activity poses unique risks to public health and safety and to the natural environment. Illegal cannabis cultivation is also potentially lucrative enough to incentivize unlawful activity at cultivation sites for as long as possible pending harvest. The intent of the board of supervisors is to therefore disincentivize such conduct by adopting higher fines and a streamlined appeal process for citations related to cannabis cultivation. B. Therefore, in cases involving cannabis cultivation on a property, the building official or his/her designee may issue a notice of violation, administrative citation and order to abate, and notice of hearing in accordance with this section. The notice of violation, administrative citation and order to abate, and notice of hearing shall: 1. Identify the owner(s) of the property upon which the violation(s) exist, as named in the records of the county assessor, and identify the occupant(s), if other than the owner(s), and if known or reasonably identifiable; 2. Describe the location of such property by its commonly-used street address, giving the name or number of the street, road, or highway and the number, if any, of the property; 3. Identify the property by reference to the assessor's parcel number; 4. Contain a statement that one or more violations of county code or other applicable law exist relating to the cultivation of cannabis on the property and describing the violation(s) that exist and the actions required to abate; 5. Contain a statement that the owner(s) or occupant(s) is required to abate the stated violation(s) within ten calendar days after the date that said notice of violation, administrative citation and order to abate, and notice of hearing was served or else fines of one thousand dollars per violation per day will begin to accrue in accordance with Chapter 17.95; 6. Notify the recipient(s) that, unless the owner(s) or occupant(s) abates the violation(s) and provides proof of abatement satisfactory to the building official, a hearing will be scheduled and held before an administrative hearing officer appointed in accordance with this section to determine whether there is any reason why the violation(s) should not be abated. The notice of violation, administrative citation and order to abate, and notice of hearing shall specify the date, time, and location of this hearing, and state that the owner(s) or occupant(s) will be given an opportunity at the hearing to present and elicit testimony and/or other evidence regarding whether the conditions existing on the property constitute a nuisance under county code, or whether there is any other good cause why those conditions should not be abated; 7. Contain a statement that, unless the owner(s) or occupant(s) abates the violation(s), or shows good cause before the administrative hearing officer why the conditions should not be abated, the building official will abate the nuisance. It shall also state that the costs of abatement, including administrative costs, may be made a special assessment added to the county assessment roll and become a lien on the real property. B. The notice of violation, administrative citation and order to abate, and notice of hearing shall be: (1) served by overnight mail or overnight courier service on the owner(s) and occupant(s) (if different) pursuant to the provisions of Sections 8.06.200 and 8.06.210, and (2) posted in two (2) conspicuous locations on the subject property. The failure of any owner(s) or occupant(s) to allow the posting of notice or to receive a notice of violation, administrative citation and order to abate, and notice of hearing served in accordance with this section shall not affect the validity of the proceedings under this section. C. The board of supervisors hereby establishes the office of county hearing officer pursuant to Chapter 14 (commencing with Section 27720) of Part 3 of Division 2 of Title 3 of the California Government Code, to which office the board of supervisors shall by resolution appoint one or more administrative hearing officers. The clerk of the office of the county hearing officer shall be responsible for recruiting, selecting, and invoicing all qualified neutral hearing officers. The mailing and physical address of the office of the county hearing officer shall be: Office of Calaveras County Hearing Officer, c/o Calaveras County Administration Office, 891 Mountain Ranch Road, San Andreas, California, 95249. D. Qualifications of Administrative Hearing Officer(s). Each hearing officer shall be an attorney at law in good standing who has been admitted to practice before the courts of the state of California for at least five years. E. Appointment, Term, and Compensation of Administrative Hearing Officer(s). Hearing officers shall be independent contractors appointed for a period of not less than one year. In the event that the board of supervisors appoints more than one hearing officer, each hearing required under this section shall be assigned to a hearing officer set by the clerk of the office of the county hearing officer using an alphabetical rotation or computer-generated random draw. The board of supervisors shall approve by resolution policies and procedures relating to the contracting with and compensation of administrative hearing officers. The compensation and/or future appointments of an administrative hearing officer shall not be directly or indirectly conditioned upon substance of his/her rulings, including but not limited to the amount of administrative fines levied. F. Powers of the Administrative Hearing Officer(s). Hearing officers shall have all powers enumerated in Government Code Sections 27721 and 27722 as well as the power to in his or her discretion continue a hearing for no more than ten days upon a showing of good cause by a party of interest, the power to prepare a record of the proceedings, and the power to uphold fines and abatement orders and order that the cost of the abatement be specially assessed against the parcel. G. Administrative Hearings and Procedures. Pursuant to Government Code Sections 25845(i) and 27721(A), the hearing officer shall hold an administrative hearing to determine whether the conditions described in the notice of violation, administrative citation and order to abate, and notice of hearing constitute a nuisance under county code or other relevant law, or whether there is any other good cause why the conditions should not be abated. The hearing shall be held no less than fourteen days after service of the notice of violation, administrative citation and order to abate, and notice of hearing. Upon written request by an owner or occupant received by the clerk of the office of the county hearing officer no less than five days before the scheduled hearing date, the hearing may be continued one time upon a showing of good cause and at the discretion of the hearing officer, for not longer than ten days. 1. General Rules. Administrative hearings are intended to be informal in nature. Formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply. Witnesses shall be sworn. The hearing officer may question witnesses at any time and recall them as necessary for further testimony. All participants, including parties, counsel, and witnesses, will be expected to maintain a civil demeanor and to present only relevant evidence. The hearing officer is not required to accept into the record evidence that is irrelevant to the matter before it. 2. Hearing Procedures. a. The building official shall post the county's staff report, including relevant evidence to be considering by the hearing officer, on the Calaveras County Code Compliance website at least five days before the scheduled hearing date. b. The owner or occupant shall be given an opportunity at the hearing to present and elicit testimony or other evidence regarding whether the conditions existing on the property constitute a nuisance under this chapter, whether there is any other good cause why those conditions should not be abated, or whether any fines were levied inappropriately. c. In the event that the owner or occupant does not appear and present evidence at the hearing, the hearing officer may base his or her decision solely upon the evidence submitted by the building official or his/her designee. Failure of the owner or occupant to appear and present evidence at the hearing shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. d. The hearing officer shall consider the matter de novo, and may affirm, reverse, or modify the determinations contained in the notice of violation, administrative citation and order to abate, and notice of hearing. 3. Post-Hearing Procedures. a. The hearing officer shall issue a written decision, which shall include findings relating to the existence or nonexistence of the alleged violation(s), findings related to the appropriateness of the fines levied, and findings concerning the propriety and means of abating the conditions set forth in the notice of violation, administrative citation and order to abate, and notice of hearing. Such decision shall be mailed to, or personally served upon, the party requesting the hearing, any other parties upon whom the administrative citation and order was served, and the building official. If an owner or occupant was represented by counsel at the hearing, then a copy of the decision shall instead be mailed to or personally served upon his/her counsel in lieu of being delivered or mailed to the owner or occupant. The decision shall constitute the county's final administrative decision when signed by the hearing officer and served as herein provided. b. The written decision must contain a statement of the violation(s) and/or nuisance(s) requiring abatement; findings of fact on material issues and the grounds in the record for those findings; any related conclusions of law or policy; any aggravating or mitigating circumstances that are pertinent to the decision; any costs, fines, and penalties and the reasons therefor; and, if requested by the building official or his/her designee, an order authorizing the county to abate the nuisance and for the cost of the abatement to be specially assessed against the parcel.

A. Pursuant to the requirements of Govt. Code § 25123(d), the board of supervisors has determined that the provisions contained in this chapter are necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the unincorporated areas of Calaveras County. Such determination is based on the following factual circumstances. B. The use and discharge of fireworks within the county presents a serious hazard to the health, welfare, and safety of individuals and property within the county. This hazard is most pronounced during the July Fourth seasonal celebration. C. It is anticipated that due to worsening drought, rising temperatures, and arid fuels, the 2021 fire season could prove devasting for California. In response, the governor has proposed a record budget in an to attempt to mitigate a potentially disastrous fire season. D. In 2020, a historic four million two hundred fifty-seven thousand eight hundred sixty-three acres of California burned, the largest fire season in modern history. As of May 25, 2021, there have already been over two thousand five hundred wildfires in the state, a significant increase over the same period of time last year. According to Cal Fire, as of May 28, 2021, an estimated fifteen thousand four hundred fifty-eight acres have burned statewide. E. Whereas multiple fire protection districts within Calaveras County ban fireworks, there is no countywide prohibition, causing disparity between districts and the risk of fireworks-related fires, injuries, and damage to property within the county as a whole. F. In Calaveras Consolidated Fire Protection District's territory alone, as of May 26, 2021, the district has responded to 27 vegetation fires within its district this season and an additional three vegetation fires with a neighboring fire district on the border with San Joaquin County. Of those thirty wildland fires, twenty-six are currently presumed to have been caused by human error. Approximately three hundred acres have burned in these fires. G. According to the National Fire Protection Association, an estimated nineteen thousand five hundred fires started by fireworks were reported to fire departments nationwide in 2018. These fires caused five civilian deaths, forty-six civilian injuries, and one hundred five million dollars in direct property damages. Twenty-eight percent of the fires started by fireworks in the 2014-2018 period were reported on the Fourth of July. During that same time period, brush, grass, or forest fires accounted for fifty-nine percent of fireworks-started fires. H. Local fire hazard conditions require that the use and discharge of fireworks be immediately prohibited within Calaveras County. In order to effectively prohibit the use and discharge of fireworks, it is also necessary to prohibit the sale of fireworks; if fireworks are readily available within the county, any prohibition on use will be largely ineffective without a sizable and cost-prohibitive policing effort.

A. When the building official determines that an existing address (or series of addresses) does not conform to the CNS, he/she may assign a new, conforming address to replace the former one. An entire address or any portion of an address may be corrected by the building official under this subsection. B. The discretion of the building official to assign a new address pursuant to subsection A shall be undertaken on a case- by-case basis and shall in no way be construed as imposing a duty upon the building official to investigate pre-existing addresses throughout the county to determine which of them require address correction to comport with the CNS. C. A parcel owner desiring to voluntarily request that an address (or portion of an address) assigned to a situs on his/her parcel be corrected to conform to the CNS may apply for a voluntary correction by the building official, who shall provide an application form for such purpose. The building official will review the application and, if the address is corrected, send notice of such to the applicant pursuant to subsection E. D. Examples of circumstances in which address correction pursuant to this subsection may be appropriate include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. Current address number sequencing or assignment is incorrect or nonexistent in the CNS. 2. Current addressing range along a road is misaligned or miscalculated for purposes of the CNS. 3. Current street name results in the existence of duplicate street names within the county's jurisdiction, sounds too similar to another street name within the county's jurisdiction, or otherwise fails to conform to the CNS. 4. Current addressing community area is incorrect for purposes of the CNS. E. If the building official determines that an address should be corrected, he/she shall promptly mail written notice of the correction to the owner of the affected parcel at his/her mailing address. Such notice shall explain how the prior address failed to conform to the CNS and shall also include all of the following: 1. The correct road name. 2. For each situs on the parcel, the correct numerical address. 3. The correct addressing community area assigned to the situs through the CNS. F. If a parcel owner believes that the building official has erred in his/her determination that an existing address fails to conform to the CNS, the parcel owner may submit a written request for reconsideration to the building official within thirty days of the date on which the notice per subsection E was sent, explaining why he/she believes the preexisting address conforms to the CNS. The building official shall respond in writing, either granting or denying the request for reconsideration, within thirty days after receiving the parcel owner' request and shall include a brief written explanation of the decision. The response shall be sent by mail to the parcel owner at his/her address on file with the county. G. If the parcel owner does not agree with the building official's decision with respect to his/her request for reconsideration, the parcel owner may appeal the decision to the board of supervisors within fifteen days of date on which the building official sent his/her written response to the request for reconsideration. An appeal filed under this subsection must be in writing, dated, signed by the parcel owner and submitted to the clerk of the board of supervisors. The issue on appeal shall be limited to whether or not the pre-existing address conforms to the current version of the CNS, and the appellant shall carry the burden of proof. H. An appeal filed in conformance with subsection G shall be heard by the board within forty-five days of its submission, and the determination of the board of supervisors shall be final. I. A parcel owner subject to address correction under this section shall be responsible to post, within thirty days of the date on which notice per subsection E is sent, the newly assigned address in conformance with Article 3 of the fire safe regulations the fire safe regulations adopted by the county pursuant to Chapter 15.09 of the county code. J. If address correction requires correction of a road name, the parcel owner subject to the correction shall also be mutually responsible to install and post, within thirty days of the date on which notice per subsection E is sent, a corrected road sign in conformance with Article 3 of the fire safe regulations the fire safe regulations adopted by the county pursuant to Chapter 15.09 of the county code. Unless a contrary arrangement is made through a recorded road maintenance agreement, responsibility for the future maintenance of the road sign shall be shared equally among all parcels accessed via the subject road. K. If a request for reconsideration has been timely filed, the posting requirements of subsections I and J shall, alternatively, be completed within thirty days of the date on which the notice of determination is sent. If an appeal of the reconsideration decision is timely filed, these posting requirements of subsections I and J shall be completed within thirty days of the board of supervisor's decision on the appeal.

The board of supervisors finds as follows: A. The lack of housing options for persons experiencing homelessness in Calaveras County has led to an increase in the number of encampments within the unincorporated area of the county. B. Encampments generally consist of camp facilities and camp paraphernalia such as tents, makeshift structures, sleeping bags, or blankets providing shelter to one or more individuals experiencing homelessness. C. The presence of encampments in certain areas and locations within the unincorporated areas of the county poses a threat to the public health, safety, and welfare of those residing in the encampments and the community at large, because of the damage to public property, risk of fire, unsanitary conditions, environmental degradation, accumulation of debris and garbage, and obstructed access for maintenance, operations, or emergency services purposes. D. The existence of encampments or the accumulation of debris in, on, under, or within twenty-five feet of infrastructure that is critical to the provision of public services such as law enforcement, fire protection, flood protection, transportation, and utilities including communications, water, and waste disposal, threatens the destruction of, damage to, or interference with maintenance and operation of said infrastructure. E. The establishment and presence of encampments on, in, near, or within twenty-five feet of wildfire and flood risk areas during severe weather creates hazardous conditions for residents and emergency responders. Such hazards include the risk of physical harm, loss and/or damage to personal property, and impairment or prevention of access to areas to provide emergency aid or rescue efforts. F. The prohibition on camping in these particular locations will enable the county to protect and preserve lives and infrastructure, ensure the provision of vital public services, and protect the public's health and safety during severe weather.

The purpose of this chapter is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public by prohibiting camping in, on, or near critical infrastructure, and in wildfire and flood risk areas during severe weather. The prohibition of camping in these areas is intended to mitigate the threat of fire, flooding, blocked waterways and roads, and other potential causes of destruction and damage to, and interference with, critical infrastructure and wildfire and flood risk areas, in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, by authorizing the removal of persons camping and personal property in, on, or near critical infrastructure or in wildfire and flood risk areas. This chapter is further intended to protect critical infrastructure and wildfire and flood risk areas from damage, interference, degradation, and nuisance activity related to unauthorized activities.

Unless the context otherwise requires, the definitions as set forth in this section shall govern the construction of this chapter. Abandoned Vehicle. A. A vehicle is ""abandoned"" if it is left on a highway, public property or private property in such inoperable or neglected condition that the owner's intention to relinquish all further rights or interests in it may be reasonably concluded. B. In reference to highways or public rights-of-way, ""abandonment"" is presumed to have occurred if a vehicle is parked, rests or is otherwise immobilized on any highway or public right-of-way; and lacks an engine, transmission, wheels, tires, doors, windshield, or any other part or equipment necessary to operate safely on the highway. Such vehicles are presumed to be a hazard to public health, safety and welfare and may be removed immediately upon discovery by a peace officer or other designated employee. ""Dismantled vehicle"" means any vehicle that is partially or wholly disassembled. ""Employee"" means a county employee designated by the planning director. ""Highway"" means a way or place, of whatever nature, publicly maintained and open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular traffic. Highway includes a street, and all or any part of the entire width of the right-of-way of said highway. ""Inoperative vehicle"" means any motor vehicle that cannot be moved under its own power. ""Peace officer"" means an individual as defined in Chapter 4.5, commencing with Section 830 of Title 3 of Part 2 of the Penal Code. ""Public nuisance vehicle"" means any vehicle that is abandoned, wrecked or dismantled or any inoperative parts thereof; that is on public or private property, not including highways; and that creates a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, promotes blight and deterioration, invites plundering, creates fire hazards, constitutes an attractive nuisance endangering the health and safety of minors, harbors rodents and insects, or jeopardizes health, safety or general welfare. ""Vehicle"" means a device in, upon or by which any person or property is or may be propelled, moved or drawn upon a highway, excepting a device moved by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks. ""Wrecked vehicle"" means any vehicle that is damaged to such an extent that it cannot be operated upon the highway. A vehicle which has been wrecked in a traffic accident, and which has been removed from the roadway to a storage facility, but which has not been claimed by its owner, will not be considered an abandoned vehicle. (Ord. 2257 § 1(part), 1992). ",Calaveras_County,322,Calaveras_County.pdf,542

In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the state under California Vehicle Code Section 22660 to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts as public nuisances, the board of supervisors makes the following findings and declarations: The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts, on private or public property, including highways, creates a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, promotes blight and deterioration, invites plundering, creates fire hazards, constitutes an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, creates a harborage for rodents and insects and is injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or parts, on private or public property, including highways, is declared to constitute a nuisance which may be abated in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

Substantial population and employment growth is expected in Calaveras County through 2025 and beyond. This growth will cause impacts on the regional transportation network (""regional transportation network"" including increased congestion, accident rates, and related impacts unless substantial improvements are completed. The road impact mitigation fee program (""RIM fee program"") is intended to provide funding for transportation improvements that mitigate these impacts. All new development as shown on the road impact mitigation fee schedule adopted by the board of supervisors will be subject to the fee which will be in proportion to the impact caused on the regional transportation network by such new development as may be determined by the board of supervisors in accordance with this chapter. The funding derived from the RIM fee program shall be used in combination with other funding available to regional planning entities to complete the needed transportation improvements.

A. The board of supervisors finds that future development within the unincorporated area of Calaveras County will result in traffic volumes exceeding the capacity of the existing regional network of highways and arterials identified within the regional transportation network. A map depicting the boundaries of Calaveras County and identifying the existing regional transportation network is set forth in Figure A. B. The board of supervisors finds that if the capacity of the regional transportation network is not improved, the result will be substantial traffic congestion in all parts of the unincorporated area of Calaveras County, with unacceptable levels of service by 2025. Reduced transportation service levels will result in traffic congestion and related impacts upon air quality, economic development, and quality of life. C. The board of supervisors finds, that absent a RIM fee program, existing funding sources, including federal, state, and local sources, will be inadequate to construct the regional transportation network needed to avoid the unacceptable levels of traffic congestion and related adverse impacts. D. The county is a member agency of the Calaveras council of governments (CCOG), a joint powers agency consisting of the county of Calaveras and one city situated in Calaveras County. Acting together, the member agencies of CCOG developed the RIM fee program whereby the shortfall in funds needed to expand the capacity of the regional transportation network could be made up in part by a road impact mitigation fee (""RIM fee"") on future development. As a member agency of CCOG, the county participated in the preparation of the ""Calaveras County Road Impact Mitigation Fee Nexus Study,"" finalized April 28, 2004, and prepared pursuant to California Government Code, Section 66000 et seq., the Mitigation Fee Act (the ""RIM fee nexus study""). E. The board of supervisors has reviewed the RIM fee nexus study, and finds that future development within the unincorporated areas of the county will substantially adversely affect the regional transportation network, and that unless such development contributes to the cost of improving the regional transportation network, the regional transportation network will operate at unacceptable levels of service. Adoption of a road impact mitigation fee program, which establishes a RIM fee, and related cooperation with CCOG to fund regional transportation improvements will be augmented by other funding sources and help assure that needed improvements to the regional transportation network are completed. F. The board of supervisors finds and determines that the failure to mitigate growing traffic impacts on the regional transportation network within Calaveras County will substantially impair the ability of public safety services, including police and fire, to respond; increase accident rates; reduce air quality; and negatively affect economic development and the overall quality of life in the region. As a result, the failure to mitigate impacts on the regional transportation network will adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare. G. The board of supervisors finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the use of the RIM fees and the type of development projects on which the fees are imposed because the fees will be used to construct the transportation improvements that are necessary for the safety, health and welfare of the users of the development projects on which the RIM fee will be levied, as shown on the road impact mitigation fee schedule. H. The board of supervisors finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the need for the improvements to the regional transportation network and the type of development projects on which the RIM fee is imposed because it will be necessary for the residential and non-residential users of such projects to have access to the regional transportation network. Such development will benefit from the regional transportation network improvements and the burden of such development will be mitigated in part by the payment of the RIM fees. I. The board of supervisors finds and determines that the cost estimates set forth in the RIM fee nexus study are reasonable cost estimates for constructing the identified regional transportation network improvements and projects (""RIM fee capital projects"" or ""capital projects"") and that the amount of the RIM fee expected to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share cost to such development. J. The fees collected pursuant to the ordinance codified in this chapter shall be used to help pay for the construction and/or acquisition of the regional transportation network improvements identified in the RIM fee nexus study in the RIM fee cost estimate summary or RIM fee capital projects. The need for the improvements is related to new development because such development results in additional traffic thus creating the demand for the improvements. K. By notice duly given and published, the board of supervisors set the time and place for a public hearing on the RIM fee nexus study and the RIM fees proposed thereunder, and at least ten days prior to the hearing, the county made the RIM fee nexus study available to the public. L. At the time and place set for the public hearing, the board of supervisors duly considered that data and information provided by the public relative to the cost of the services for which the RIM fees are proposed and all other comments, whether written or oral, submitted prior to the conclusion of the hearing. M. The board of supervisors finds that the RIM fee nexus study establishes a fair and equitable method for distributing a portion of the unfunded costs of improvements to the regional transportation network. N. The board of supervisors adopts the RIM fee nexus study. O. The board of supervisors finds that the fee imposed on new development is proportional to the impact of that development on the regional transportation network. P. The board of supervisors finds that the RIM fees collected will be deposited in an account that is established and may be appropriated for the purpose of constructing the capital projects.

B. Credits. RIM fee capital projects constructed by a developer may be credited toward the RIM fee in accordance with the following: 1. Arterial Credits. If a developer constructs arterial improvements identified on the regional transportation network, the developer shall receive credit for the costs associated with the arterial component based on approved unit cost assumptions for the regional transportation network. The credits will be allowed for items that exceed standard requirements for road improvements, and any additional construction not adjacent to the development excluding required road improvement transitions. 2. Other Credits. In special circumstances, when a developer constructs off-site improvements such as an interchange, bridge, or railroad grade separation, credits shall be determined by the county. 3. The amount of the credit shall not exceed the actual costs of construction of the RIM fee capital project. 4. If there is a recognized benefit district established, the local agency may credit that portion of the facility identified in both programs against the RIM fee. (Ord. 2777 § 1(part), 2004). (Ord.

A. Authority of the Administrator. The board of supervisors shall, by resolution, designate the RIM fee program administrator. The administrator, or his/her designee, is hereby authorized to levy and collect the RIM fee and make all determinations required by the ordinance codified herein. B. Payment of RIM fees shall be as follows: 1. The RIM fee program fees shall be paid no later than the date of issuance of the building permit or issuance of other grant of entitlement for development that has a traffic impact but does not require a building permit. 2. The amount of the RIM fees shall be the fee amounts in effect at the time of payment. C. Adjustments. 1. The owner of a development project subject to the RIM fee under this chapter may apply to the RIM fee program administrator for an adjustment to that fee. The waiver of this fee shall be based on the absence of any reasonable relationship between the impact on the development on the regional transportation network and the amount of fee charged. 2. The application for adjustment may be made in writing and filed with the RIM fee program administrator no later than thirty days after payment of the fee. The application shall state in detail the factual basis and legal theory for the claim of adjustment. 3. It is the intent of this chapter that: a. The land use categories are based on general plan designations which are an average of a wide range of specific land uses; thus substantial variation must be shown in order to justify a fee adjustment; b. Each fee adjustment or waiver shall be considered individually and thus it may occur that a fee adjustment or waiver is made in one category and not another; and c. Where improvements providing capacity for the subject parcel have already been constructed, a downward adjustment of the fee is not appropriate. 4. The RIM fee program administrator, or his/her designee, shall consider the application and shall issue a written decision on the request within thirty days after the filing of the fee adjustment application. 5. The applicant bears the burden of proof in presenting substantial evidence to support the application. The following factors shall be considered in the determination whether or not to approve a fee adjustment: a. The applicability of the category of fee established by resolution of the board of supervisors to the type of development, or b. The applicability of the fee to the type of development based on the methodology of the latest edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineers Trip Generation Manual; and, c. The substance and nature of the evidence including the applicant's technical data supporting the request. The applicant must present technical information to show that the fee is inappropriate for the particular development. D. Refunds. If a building permit expires, is revoked or is voluntarily surrendered and therefore voided, and no construction or improvement of land has been commenced, the fee payer shall be entitled to a refund of the RIM fee with any interest accrued thereon, paid as a condition of issuance of the building permit. Assignment of the right to a refund may be requested in writing by the fee payer with a notarized signature. (Ord. 2777 § 1(part), 2004). (Ord.

A. Land development projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants, and; stormwater runoff, soil erosion, and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through stormwater regulation. This chapter is enacted for the following purposes: 1. To protect public health, welfare, and property and to preserve environmental resources by controlling the discharge of pollutants into county-maintained stormwater collection and conveyance systems. 2. To provide Calaveras County with the legal authority needed to fulfill its discharge permit obligations as a ""regulated municipal small storm sewer system (MS4)"" operator as designated by the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board. 3. To minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development site in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels. 4. To reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety. B. Where conflicts occur between this chapter and other local, state, or federal laws or regulations, the most restrictive shall apply. (Ord. No. 3121, § 1, 10-22-2019; Ord.

A. This chapter of the Calaveras County Code shall be enforced by the Director of the Calaveras County Department of Public Works (director) or his/her designee. The director may delegate his/her responsibilities to enforce this chapter to a code enforcement officer or other designee, either individually or collectively. B. To ensure compliance with State Water Resources Control Board Waste Discharge requirements for stormwater discharges from MS4's and the provisions of this chapter requiring the county to detect and eliminate illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4, the director may enter properties at all reasonable times in the manner provided by law. The entry onto private property shall be to inspect any facilities, equipment, practices, or operations for active or potential illicit discharges. If such entry is refused, the director shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry. C. The director has the authority to respond to the discharge of spills and prohibit dumping or disposal of materials other than stormwater into the MS4. D. This chapter shall be applicable to all subdivision or site plan applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver from the Calaveras County Department of Public Works. This chapter also applies to land development activities that are between two thousand five hundred square feet and five thousand square feet if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. To prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff, the Calaveras County Department of Public Works has developed as set of performance standards that must be met at new development sites. These standards apply to any construction activity disturbing two thousand five hundred or more square feet of land. The following activities may be exempt from these stormwater performance criteria. 1. Any logging and agriculture activity which is consistent with an approved soil conservation plan, or a timber management plan prepared or approved by Calaveras County. 2.

A. The control of pollutants including but not limited to trash, erosion and sediment shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Chapter 15.05, Grading and Drainage of the Calaveras County Code, and with the California Stormwater Quality Association (CASQA) Best Management Practice Handbook or equivalent. B. Owners of property including new development projects, redevelopment projects, industrial and commercial facilities, and construction site operators are required to minimize the discharge of pollutants to the MS4 through installation, implementation, and continued maintenance of BMPs consistent with the California Stormwater Quality Association (CASQA) Best Management Practice Handbook or equivalent. 1. Minimum Controls. a. Preliminary plans shall be included in submittals for project approvals showing proposed BMPs to be implemented during development and permanent BMPs to be maintained. All stormwater management practices will be designed so that the specific storm frequency storage volumes (e.g., recharge, water quality, channel protection, ten-year, one hundred year) as identified in the current stormwater design manual are met, unless the Calaveras County Department of Public Works grants the applicant a waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, Calaveras County Department of Public Works reserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff. 2. Site Design Feasibility. a. Stormwater management practices for a site shall be chosen based on the physical conditions of the site. Among the factors that should be considered: i. Topography. ii. Maximum drainage area. iii. Depth to water table. iv. Soils. v. Terrain. vi. Head. vii. Location in relation to environmentally sensitive features or ultra-urban areas. 3. Conveyance Issues. a. All stormwater management practices shall be designed to convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include, but not be limited to: i. Maximizing of flow paths from inflow points to outflow points. ii. Protection of inlet and outfall structures. iii. Elimination of erosive flow velocities. iv. Providing of underdrain systems, where applicable. 4. Pretreatment Requirements. a. Every stormwater treatment practice shall have an acceptable form of water quality pretreatment, in accordance with the pre-treatment requirements as specified in the Grading, Drainage and Erosion Control Design Manual, are prohibited even with pre-treatment in the following circumstances: i. Stormwater is generated from highly contaminated source areas known as ""hotspots."" ii. Stormwater is carried in a conveyance system that also carries contaminated, non-stormwater discharges. iii. Stormwater is being managed in a designated groundwater recharge area. iv. Certain geologic conditions exist (e.g., karst) that prohibit the proper pretreatment of stormwater. 5. Treatment/Geometry Conditions. a. All stormwater management practices shall be designed to capture and treat stormwater runoff according to the specification outlined in the Grading, Drainage and Erosion Control Design Manual. These specifications will designate the water quantity and quality treatment criteria that apply to an approved stormwater management practice. C. Parties responsible for runoff in excess of incidental runoff shall implement the following measures: 1. Detect leaks (for example, from broken sprinkler heads) and correct the leaks within seventy-two hours of learning of the leak; 2. Properly design and aim sprinkler heads; and 3. Not irrigate during precipitation events. D. Notwithstanding C3, owners of ponds containing recycled water shall ensure that no discharge occurs unless the discharge is a result of a twenty-five-year, twenty-four-hour storm event or greater, and the appropriate regional water board is notified by email no later than twenty-four hours after the discharge. 1. The notification is to include identifying information, including the permittee's name and permit identification number. E. Owners of properties with exposed soils having the potential to impact stormwater flows or any water way shall permanen stabilize the soils using BMPs. 1. During operations when soil is disturbed, temporary measures may be used. F. New Development. All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specific design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity. G. New Development. Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained, by promoting infiltration through the use of structural and non-structural methods. At a minimum, annual recharge from the post development site shall mimic the annual recharge conditions. H. To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel protection criterion shall be provided as prescribed in the current Grading, Drainage, and Erosion Control Manual. I. Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (i.e., cold water fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas, water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional performance criteria or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices. J. Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) and shall file a notice of intent (NOI) under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) general permit. The stormwater pollution prevention plan requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites. K. Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher potential pollutant loadings known as ""hotspots,"" may require the use of specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention practices.

A. Fees shall be assessed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and as set forth in the fee schedule adopted by the board of supervisors. Fees shall be paid for plan review, issuance of a permit, inspections and reinspections and appeals of permit denials. 1. When a plan or other data are submitted by a consultant, a plan review fee shall be paid at the time of submitting plan data for review. Where submitted plans are incomplete or changes are required so as to necessitate additional plan re additional plan review fee shall be charged. 2. Permit fees shall be paid in addition to any other fees and paid at the time a permit is applied for. 3. An inspection or reinspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made. B. Reinspection fees may be assessed when the permit card is not properly posted on the work site, the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date for which inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the agency administrator. C. To obtain a reinspection, the applicant shall first pay a reinspection fee. This is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of this code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before a job is ready for such inspection or reinspection. D. In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have been paid. (Ord. 2921 (part), 2007: Ord. 2250 § 1 Exh.

It is the declared policy of Calaveras County to conserve and protect agricultural land and to encourage agricultural operations within the county. Where nonagricultural land uses, especially residential development, extend into agricultural areas or are adjacent to agricultural areas, agricultural operations may become the subject of nuisance complaints, due to a lack of knowledge about the operations. As a result, agricultural operations are sometimes forced to cease or curtail operations and people are discouraged from making investments in farm improvements to the detriment of agricultural operations and the economic viability of the county's agricultural industry as a whole. It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to reduce the loss to the county of its agricultural resources by clarifying the circumstances under which agricultural operations may be considered a nuisance. The further purpose of this chapter is to promote a good neighbor policy by advising purchasers and residents of property near agricultural operations of the inherent potential problems associated with such purchase or residence. Such concerns may include, but are not limited to, the sounds, odors, dust, chemicals, and traffic that may accompany agricultural operations. Purchasers and residents should understand the inconvenience that accompany living side-by-side with present or future agricultural operations and be prepared to accept such problems as the natural result of living in or near agricultural lands.

The board of supervisors of the county of Calaveras finds and declares that the additions, modifications, and changes made to these codes are necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare due to climatic, geological, or topographical conditions. These amendments are authorized under Health and Safety Code Sections 18941.5 and 17958 and are identified as follows: A. Express Finding Number 1: Climatic. 1. Calaveras County's climate lies in a transitional zone between the Sierra Nevada and the San Joaquin Valley. Climate varies significantly due to great differences in elevation. Temperatures in the higher country range from the low 20's to the middle 80's. The lower foothills range in temperature from the low 30's the high 90's exceeding one hundred degrees at times during the summer months. Rainfall and snow fall generally increases with altitude, with snow accounting for much of the precipitation in the elevations above three thousand feet. 2. Calaveras County lies primarily on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada where the main weather influence comes from the Pacific Ocean in what is known as the ""Belt of the Westerlies."" The accumulation of snow in the winter months is perpetuated by the weather patterns and as the storms hit the state of California the Sierra Nevada Mountain range blocks the movement of the storm fronts and the heaver snow accumulations build up on the west slope. As is typical in the northern zones of the state the moisture content of the snow that accumulates in Calaveras County is moderate to high in moisture content. The variations in the temperatures along the western slope cause a degree of alternate thaw and freezing of the snow therefore producing concentrations of ice in the snow mass increasing the weight of the snow. This heavy mixture known as ""Sierra Cement"" imposes a load factor that is necessary to take into account for structural building design. 3. Considerations to elevation, snow load, load duration factor, roof live load and seismic snow load reduction are important elements in the design for safe building design. Design criteria for structures in the Calaveras County is required to take into account the snow and seismic components for review and approval of submitted building projects. The provisions of the 2022 California Building Code Section 1608A.1 general snow load designs shall be determined in accordance with Chapter 7 of ASCE 7, but the design roof load shall not be less than that determined by Section 1607A. 4. 2022 CBC Section 1608A.3 Determination of Snow Loads. (DSA-SS) the ground snow load or the design snow load for roofs shall conform with the adopted ordinance of the city, county or city and county in which the project site is located and shall be approved by DSA. 5. Ground snow loads to be used in the determining the design snow loads for roofs shall be determined in accordance with ASCE 7 or figure 1608A.2. Ground snow loads for sites at elevations above the limits indicated in figure 1608A.2 and for sites within the CS areas shall be approved. 6. A ground snow load chart is available for Calaveras County. Elevation for areas Calaveras County is available through various map programs. B. Express Finding Number 2: Geological. 1. Seismic Concerns. Calaveras County lies within the Sierra Block, an area of historically low siesmicity. Although the county has felt ground shaking from earthquakes with epicenters located elsewhere, no major earthquakes have been recorded within the county. The closet known source for large earthquakes is the Sierra Frontal Fault System along the eastern margin of the Sierra Nevada, which includes the Carson Valley Fault. This fault is located within a few miles of the eastern portions of the county, and has been evaluated as capable of generating earthquakes of up to the magnitude 7.0 range on the Mercalli Scale. 2. Other fault systems that could affect Calaveras County are the San Andreas Fault, the Hayward Fault, the Calaveras Fault and the Greenville Fault. Because of their distance from Calaveras County, however, events on these systems are expected to have relatively minor effects in Calaveras County (magnitude 4.0 to 5.0). The potential for seismically induced ground shaking is lower in Calaveras County than in most of California. The eastern portions of the county may be subject to somewhat stronger shaking (6.0 to 7.0) if a rupture occurs on the Carson Valley Fault. Similar intensities could occur in the western portion of the county if a magnitude 6.0 earthquake were to occur on a nearby branch of the Melones-Bear Valley Fault System. Such an event is considered very unlikely. 3. Liquefaction Hazards. Sites in Calaveras County with liquefaction potential would be those in alluvial deposits having groundwater and sand and silt layers of uniform grain sizes within about thirty feet of the surface. Such conditions are generally not present in the county. The areas of alluvial soils have some amounts of clay which minimize the liquefaction potential. 4. Slope Instability. The formation of landslides under natural conditions depends on several factors including steepness of slope, type of materials such as unconsolidated, soft sediments or surface deposits, structural properties of the materials and its orientation, rainfall influence, vegetation type, erosion influences, and seismic activity. There are several areas in Calaveras County with steep slopes of fifty percent or greater and therefore have landslide potential. Areas of particular landslide concerns are those that include high elevations and steep ravines and gulches associated with river and stream channels. Artificial slopes associated with the existing mill tailings could also be unstable. Most likely the tailings will progressively slump and gradually flatten out over time. Slope failures have the potential to impact local drainage courses and/or downstream water quality. These conditions exist to some degree within Calaveras County. 5. Expansive Soils. Soils with high clay content are considered to be expansive. Minerals in certain clays swell with increased moisture content and then contract during dry periods. The volume changes associated with seasonal variations in moisture content (called shrink-swell characteristics) can damage shallow building foundations and pavement. On slopes the continuous shrinking and swelling of expansive soils can cause the soil to migrate down slope, which can also disrupt foundations and bury utility lines. 6. Some of the soil groups with moderate to high shrink-swell potential include: a. Group 1-Very deep alluvial soils moderate to good drainage; b. Group 2-Shallow well drained gravelly soil with finer sub soils; c. Group 5-Deep to shallow, well drained, slightly acidic and rocky soils good drain; d. Group 6-Acid, rocky, stony soil over slate moderate erosion potential. 7. Flood Hazards. This section addresses three basic types of flood hazards: stream-side over bank flows; areas of flat terrain with slow surface drainage; and inundation due to structural dam failure. 8. Flooding may occur in Calaveras County from heavy rain fall with saturated soils, and unusually rapid snow melt, or a combination of those factors. Over bank flow along the main channel of the Mokelumne and Stanislaus Rivers usually results from heavy snow melt coupled with heavy rainfall. This is also true of the mid-elevation tributaries of the Mokelumne River and the upper reaches of the Calaveras River system. Farther west, the source of flood flow waters are heavy rainfall associated with repeat winter storms and a saturated soil mantle. Summer thunderstorms are also occasionally a source of flood flows. 9. Flood potential can also be affected by land development and associated alternation of natural vegetative cover. Areas of concentrated development can contribute significantly to the increased runoff as a result of roof and other impervious surface areas. Removal of vegetation without new ground cover planting can have similar effects. Large scale alteration of vegetation as a result of wildland fires can also increase flood potential. 10. Indigenous Hazardous Materials. Hazardous materials indigenous to Calaveras County are those derived from the extraction and processing of toxic metals. Mining has been the back bone of the county's economy since the Gold Rush. Copper and asbestos are two minerals having toxic qualities that have been mined in Calaveras County. Currently, there are no copper or asbestos mines operating in the county. The asbestos mine located near the Stanislaus River between New Melones and Lake Tulloch originated in the early 1900's. In 1990 the open pit mine was converted into an asbestos-containing waste landfill. 11. Imported hazardous materials are produced elsewhere and brought into the county either for the specific purposes or as airborne pollution. Minerals used for specific purposes include: pesticides and herbicides used by agriculture; liquefied gas used for energy; and chemicals and explosives used in mineral extraction and processing. The use of these materials is regulated by either federal state or local government. 12. Airborne Hazardous Materials Drift into the County by Wind. The most common form of air pollution is from valley and city agricultural enterprises. Calaveras County is a member of the regional air district, currently in the Mountain Counties Air District. C. Express Finding Number 3: Topographical. 1. Calaveras County is located in Central California along the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. The counties boundaries are the Mokelumne River on the north and the Stanislaus River on the south. The county's eastern boundary abuts Alpine County and the western boundary adjoins San Joaquin and Stanislaus Counties. The total land area of the county is six hundred fifty seven thousand nine hundred twenty acres. The county has one incorporated city, Angels Camp. The city of Angels Camp has a building department that handles the construction activities within the city limits. The county of Calaveras has jurisdiction in the remaining geographic areas of the county regulated by the building department. 2. The county is approximately fifty-three miles long from the west to the east and twenty miles wide from the north to south. The western part of Calaveras County is characterized by rolling foothills beginning at an elevation of approximately three hundred feet. The terrain rises to the east, reaching peak height of eight thousand one hundred seventy feet near the Alpine County boundary. Deep ravines and steep ridges are found between the foothills and the higher mountains. Snow accumulations can occur at all levels with a short duration at the lower elevations to a long duration at and above the three thousand foot elevation. Generally speaking a storm event usually will deposit the highest yield of snow accumulation between the elevations of six thousand and seven thousand foot elevations. In as much as the county has a diverse range of snow load profiles, the design criteria for buildings related to their construction requires special consideration. (Ord.

A. This chapter is enacted for the following purposes: 1. To regulate grading, drainage, and other earthwork activities within the unincorporated areas of Calaveras County to preserve and safeguard public welfare, life, health, and property; 2. To ensure that the intended use of a graded site is consistent with the Calaveras County general plan (including adopted Community Plans), the County's Storm Water Management Plan, California Fire Safe Standards, and local ordinances, including the county zoning ordinance, the county road ordinance, and applicable building codes; 3. To require implementation of erosion and sedimentation control measures to protect water quality and to reduce the discharge of pollutants into county storm water drainage systems to the maximum extent practicable using best management practices; and 4. To establish authority and procedures for the issuance of grading permits; for the approval of grading plans; for inspection of earthwork activities; and, for enforcement of the provisions herein. B. Where conflicts occur between this chapter and other local, state, or federal law or regulation, the most restrictive shall apply. The exemption of certain activities from the grading permit requirements of this chapter does not relieve any person of the need to obtain any other permits or other authorizations that may be otherwise required with that activity.

A. The flood hazard areas of Calaveras County are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. B. These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. (Ord. No. 2955, 8-19-2008).

It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide [i.e. mudflow] or flood related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to: A. Protect human life and health; B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions; E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. No. 2955, 8-19-2008). ",Calaveras_County,454,Calaveras_County.pdf,258

In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to: A. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; D. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and E. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. (Ord. No. 2955, 8-19-2008).

Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter it's most reasonable application. ""A zone""—See ""special flood hazard area"". ""Accessory structure"" means a structure that is either: 1. Solely for the parking of no more than two cars; or 2. A small, low cost shed for limited storage, less than one hundred fifty square feet and fifteen hundred dollars in value. ""Accessory use"" means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. ""Alluvial fan"" means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration. ""Apex"" means the point of highest elevation on an alluvial fan, which on undisturbed fans is generally the point where the major stream that formed the fan emerges from the mountain front. ""Appeal"" means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter. ""Area of shallow flooding"" means a designated AO or AH zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. ""Area of special flood hazard"" see ""special flood hazard area."" ""Base flood"" means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the ""one-hundred-year flood""). Base flood is the term used throughout this chapter. ""Base flood elevation"" (BFE) means the elevation shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map for zones AE, AH, A1-30, VE and V1- V30 that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. ""Basement"" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (i.e. below ground level) on all sides. ""Building"" see ""structure."" ""Development"" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. ""Encroachment"" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. ""Existing manufactured home park or subdivision"" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before March 31, 1986 (Ord. 1793). ""Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision"" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). ""Flood, flooding"" or ""floodwater"" means: 1. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and 2. The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. ""Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM)"" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway. ""Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)"" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. ""Flood Insurance Study"" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. ""Floodplain"" or ""flood-prone area"" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See ""flooding."" ""Floodplain administrator"" is the community official designated by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. ""Floodplain management"" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations and open space plans. ""Floodplain management regulations"" means this chapter, zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. ""Floodproofing"" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93. ""Floodway"" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as ""regulatory floodway."" ""Floodway fringe"" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted. ""Fraud and victimization"" as related to Sections 15.06.061 through 15.06.063 of this chapter means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the board of supervisors will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. ""Functionally dependent use"" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. ""Governing body"" is the local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. ""Hardship"" as related to Sections 15.06.161 through 15.06.163 of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The board of supervisors requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as exceptional hardships. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. ""Highest adjacent grade"" means the highest natural elevation of ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. ""Historic structure"" means any structure that is: 1. Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 2. Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 3. Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Department of Interior; or 4. Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states with approved programs. ""Levee"" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. ""Levee system"" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. ""Lowest floor"" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement see ""basement"" definition). 1. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area (see ""basement""), is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: a. The flood openings standard in subsection 16.06.051.C.3; b. The anchoring standards in subsection 16.06.051.A; c. The construction materials and methods standards in subsection 16.06.051.B; and d. The standards for utilities in Section 16.06.052. ""Manufactured home"" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term manufactured home does not include a recreational vehicle. ""Manufactured home park or subdivision"" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. ""Market value"" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. 1. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. 2. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. ""Mean sea level"" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. ""New construction,"" for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after March 31, 1986 (Ord. 1793), and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. ""New manufactured home park or subdivision"" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after March 31, 1986 (Ord. 1793). ""Obstruction"" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of waters, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. ""One-hundred-year flood"" or ""100-year flood"" see ""base flood."" ""Principal structure"" means a structure used for the principal use of the property as distinguished from an accessory use. ""Program deficiency"" means a defect in a community's floodplain management regulations or administrative procedures that impairs effective implementation of those floodplain management regulations. ""Public safety and nuisances"" as related to Sections 15.06.061 through 15.06.063 of this chapter means the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal or basin. ""Recreational vehicle"" means a vehicle which is: 1. Built on a single chassis; 2. Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 3. Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 4. Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. ""Regulatory floodway"" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. ""Remedy a violation"" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. ""Riverine"" means relating to, formed by or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. ""Sheet flow area""—See ""area of shallow flooding."" ""Special flood hazard area (SFHA)"" means an area having special flood hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH. ""Start of construction"" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. ""Structure"" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. ""Substantial damage"" means: 1. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred; or 2. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This is also known as ""repetitive loss."" ""Substantial improvement"" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not include either: 1. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 2. Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. ""Variance"" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. ""Violation"" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. ""Water surface elevation"" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. ""Watercourse"" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which water flows at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. (Ord. No. 2955, 8-19-2008).

The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: A. Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine that: 1. The permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; 2. All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 3. The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and 4. The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the County of Calaveras. 5. All Letters of Map Revision (LOMR's) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. building permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the ""start of construction"" definition. B. Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures. 1. Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, ""Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings,"" develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining ""market value."" 2. Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff C. Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.06.032, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Sections 15.06.051 through 15.06.056. Any such information shall be submitted to the board of supervisors for adoption. NOTE: A base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, ""Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas—A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations"" dated July 1995. D. Notification of Other Agencies. 1. In alteration or relocation of a watercourse: a. Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; b. Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency; and c. Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 2. Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations: a. Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). b. All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on Conditional Letters of Map Revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the ""start of construction"" definition. Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 3. Changes in corporate boundaries: Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. E. Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 1.

In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required: A. Anchoring. 1. All new construction and substantial improvements of structures, including manufactured homes, shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 2. All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of Section 15.06.054. B. Construction Materials and Methods. All new construction and substantial improvement, including manufactured homes, shall be constructed: 1. With flood resistant materials, and utility equipment resistant to flood damage for areas below the base flood elevation; 2. Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 3. With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; and. 4. Within zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. C. Elevation and Floodproofing. (See Section 15.06.020 definitions for ""new construction,"" ""substantial damage"" and ""substantial improvement."") 1. Residential construction. All new construction or substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement: a. In AE, AH, A1-30 zones, elevated two feet above the base flood elevation. b. In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height two feet above the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least four feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. c. In an A zone, without BFE's specified on the FIRM [unnumbered A zone], elevated two feet above the base flood elevation; as determined under subsection 15.06.042C.. Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement, shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 2. Nonresidential construction. All new construction or substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall either be elevated to conform with subsection 15.06.051C.1. or: a. Be floodproofed, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, below the elevation recommended under subsection 15.06.051.C.1. so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; b. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and c. Be certified by a registered civil engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection 15.06.051C.2.a. and b. are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 3. Flood openings. All new construction and substantial improvements of structures with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exits of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must exceed the flooding minimum criteria: a. For non-engineered openings: 1. Have a minimum of two openings on different sides having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 2. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; 3. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater; and 4. Buildings with more than one enclosed area must have openings on exterior walls for each area to allow flood water to directly enter; or b. Be certified by a registered civil engineer or architect. 4. Crawlspace Construction. This subsection applies to buildings with crawl spaces up to two feet below grade. Below-grade crawl space construction in accordance with the requirements listed below will not be considered basements. a. The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Crawl space construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a registered architect or professional engineer; b. The crawl space is an enclosed area below the BFE and, as such, must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. For guidance on flood openings, see FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-93; c. Crawl space construction is not permitted in V zones. Open pile or column foundations that withstand storm surge and wave forces are required in V zones; d. Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation walls of the crawl space used to elevate the building, but also any joists, insulation, or other materials that extend below the BFE; and e. Any building utility systems within the crawl space must be elevated above BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions. f. Requirements for all below-grade crawl space construction, in addition to the above requirements, to include the following: 1. The interior grade of a crawl space below the BFE must not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG), shown as D in figure 3 of Technical Bulletin 11-01; 2. The height of the below-grade crawl space, measured from the interior grade of the crawl space to the top of the crawl space foundation wall must not exceed four feet (shown as L in figure 3 of Technical Bulletin 11-01) at any point; 3. There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawl space within a reasonable period of time after a flood event, not to exceed seventy-two hours; and 4. The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five feet per second for any crawl space. For velocities in excess of five feet per second, other foundation types should be used. 5.

The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants or the property owners. It is the duty of the board of supervisors to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling, and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevations or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. (Ord. No. 2955, 8-19-2008). ",Calaveras_County,469,Calaveras_County.pdf,297

A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 15.06.040 and 15.06.050 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variances increases. B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures (as defined in Section 15.06.020 of this chapt upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure C. Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. D. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. ""Minimum necessary"" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the board of supervisors need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the board of supervisors believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. E. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the floodplain administrator that: 1. The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and 2. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the County of Calaveras Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. F. The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

A. In passing upon requests for variances, the board of supervisors shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter and the: 1. Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 2. Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 3. Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 4. Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 5. Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 6. Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 7. Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 8. Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 9. Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 10. Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and 11. Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system, and streets and bridges. B. Variances shall only be issued upon a: 1. Showing of good and sufficient cause; 2. Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship (as defined in Section 15.06.020 o chapter) to the applicant; and determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, a threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Section 15.06.020 see ""public nuisance""), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 15.06.020) of the public, or conflict with existing local law ordinances. C. Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sections 15.06.061 through 15.06.063 are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in addition threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. D. Upon consideration of the factors of subsection 15.06.062A. and the purposes of this chapter, the board of supervisors may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

A. In order to implement the goals and objectives of the county general plan and to mitigate impacts caused by new development within the county, public facilities fees may be necessary. The fees are needed to finance public facilities and to assure that new development pays its fair share for these improvements. B. The board of supervisors finds and determines that: 1. New development projects cause the need for construction, expansion or improvement of public facilities within the county. 2. Funds for construction, expansion or improvement of public facilities are not available to accommodate needs caused by development projects, which can result in inadequate public facilities. The board of supervisors finds that the public health, safety, and general welfare may be promoted by the adoption of public facilities fees for construction, expansion or improvement of public facilities to insure adequate public facilities in a period of unprecedented county population growth. The board further finds that failure to adopt fees for construction expansion or improvement of public facilities may result in inadequate facilities and conditions perilous to the health, safety and welfare of county residents.

Title 15 - BUILDINGS AND CONSTRUCTION,Chapter 15.08 - CALAVERAS FIRE MITIGATION FEE ORDINANCE,15.08.030 - Purpose.,"Calaveras_County | Title 15 - BUILDINGS AND CONSTRUCTION | Chapter 15.08 - CALAVERAS FIRE MITIGATION FEE ORDINANCE | 15.08.030 - Purpose.
This chapter is enacted pursuant to State Mitigation Fee Act, as set forth in Chapter 5, Division 1, Title 7 of the California Government Code (commencing with Section 66000) to provide the authority for and process by which development fees may be imposed for fire prevention, suppression and emergency response within the unincorporated territory of the county covered by district's legal geographic area of responsibility. Such fees may be imposed by the county for the district whose proposed improvements can be financed based upon a reasonable relationship between new development and the fee to be charged. It is intended that new development shall pay its fair share to maintain the pre-existing level of service, thereby mitigating the impact of development on a District's ability to provide such service. Specifically: The Legislature passed the Mitigation Fee Act ""in response to concerns among developers that local agencies were imposing development fees for purposes unrelated to development projects."" (Ehrlich v. City of Culver City (1996) 12 Cal.4th 854, 864) The Act creates uniform procedures for local agencies to follow in establishing, imposing, collecting, accounting for, and using development fees. (Centex Real Estate Corp. v. City of Vallejo (1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1358, 1361-1362) In passing the Act, the Legislature found and declared that ""untimely or improper allocation of development fees hinders economic growth and is, therefore, a matter of statewide interest and concern."" (Section 66006, subd. (e).) The Act defines a development fee as ""a monetary exaction other than a tax or special assessment... that is charged by a local agency to the applicant in connection with approval of a development project for the purpose of defraying all or a portion of the cost of public facilities related to the development project..."" (Section 66000, subd. (b).) ""A fee shall not include the costs attributable to existing deficiencies in public facilities, but may include the costs attributable to the increased demand for public facilities reasonably related to the development project in order to (1) refurbish existing facilities to maintain the existing level of service or (2) achieve an adopted level of service that is consistent with the general plan."" (Section 66001, subd. (g).) ""Public facilities' includes public improvements, public services, and community amenities."" (Section 66000, subd. (d).) To establish a development fee a local agency must identify ""the purpose of the fee"" and ""the use to which the fee is to be put."" (Section 66001, subd. (a).) The agency also must determine that both ""the fee's use"" and ""the need for the public facility"" are reasonably related to ""the type of development project on which the fee is imposed."" (Home Builders Assn. of Tulare/Kings Counties, Inc. v. City of Lemoore (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 554, 561) ""The Act thus codifies, as the statutory standard applicable by definition to nonpossessory monetary exactions, the 'reasonable relationship' standard employed in California and elsewhere to measure the validity of required dedications of land (or fees in lieu of such dedications) that are challenged under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments."" (Ehrlich, supra, 12 Cal.4th at p. 865.) To impose an established development fee as a condition of approval for a specific development project, a local agency must ""determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee and the cost of the public facility or portion of the public facility attributable to the development on which the fee is imposed."" (Section 66001, subd. (b).) The agency also must ""identify the public improvement that the fee will be used to finance."" (Section 66006, subd. (f).) Each development fee a local agency collects must be deposited ""in a separate capital facilities account or fund in a manner to avoid any commingling of the fees with other revenues and funds of the local agency."" (Sections 66006, subd. (a); 66001, subd. (c).) A local agency must expend all development fees its collects ""solely and exclusively for the purpose or purposes"" the agency identified when it imposed the fee on a development project (Section 66008; see Section 66006, subd. (a)), and the public facilities built or established with the fee must serve the developments on which the fee was imposed (Home Builders, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 566). A development fee may not be ""levied, collected, or imposed for general revenue purposes."" (Section 66008; see Section 66006, subd. (a).) At the end of each fiscal year, a local agency must separately account for each development fee it collected by providing the public certain information, including a brief description of the fee and its amount, the beginning and ending balance of the account in which the fee was deposited, the amount of fees collected and interest earned, an identification of each public improvement on which the fee was expended, and an approximate date when construction will begin on any incomplete public improvement identified when the fee was imposed if the agency determines it has collected sufficient funds to finance the identified improvement. (Section 66006, subd. (b)(1).) If the agency does not provide an approximate start date for construction within one hundred eighty days of determining it has collected sufficient funds, the agency must refund the unexpended portion of the fee and all accrued interest to the current owners of the properties on which the fee was imposed. (Section 66001, subd. (e).) When a local agency has not used all of a development fee within five years of the date it started to collect the fee, the agency must make findings that (1) identify the agency's purpose in holding the unexpended balance; (2) demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the unexpended balance and the purpose identified when the agency assessed the fee; (3) identify the sources and funding anticipated to complete any incomplete public improvement identified when the fee was established; and (4) designate the approximate date the agency expects that funding to be deposited in the account holding the unexpended balance. (Section 66001, subd. (d)(1).) These findings therefore require the local agency to affirmatively demonstrate that it still needs the unexpended fee to achieve the purpose for which it was originally imposed, and that the agency has a plan on how to use the unexpended balance to achieve that purpose. These findings are due at the end of each five-year period if the agency continues to hold an unexpended portion of a development fee. (Ibid.) The Act requires the agency to refund the unexpended fees to the current owners of the affected properties if it fails to make the five-year findings. (Section 66001, subd. (d)(2).) The five-year findings requirement establishes ""a mechanism... to guard against unjustified fee retention"" by a local agency (Home Builders, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at p. 565) and it ensures the agency ""refund[s] any portion of [a development] fee not expended within five years unless the local agency can demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the unexpended fee and its purpose"" (Centex, supra, 19 Cal.App.4th at p. 1361). In short, for all unexpended development fees, the agency must make findings every fifth year that identify how the fee will be used, demonstrate a reasonable relationship between the fee and the purpose for which it is charged, identify all sources and amounts of funding anticipated to complete financing for incomplete improvements that were identified when the fee was established, and designate the approximate dates for that funding to be deposited into a dedicated account. (Section 66001, subd. (d)(1).) The public agency must make these findings ""in connection with"" the annual report the Act requires the agency to provide. (Section 66001, subd. (d)(2).) If these findings are not made, ""the local agency shall refund the moneys in the account or fund"" to the then current owners of the affected properties on a prorated basis plus accrued interest. (Section 66001, subds. (d)(2) and (e); see Home Builders, supra, 185 Cal.App.4th at pp. 565—566.) (Ord. No. 3068, § 3, 3-8-2016) ",Calaveras_County,475,Calaveras_County.pdf,1803

A fire protection district impact fee may not be established unless requested by a district seeking establishment of a fee under this chapter via district resolution which identifies new, specific, and an identifiable development project or projects upon which a fee is to be imposed, and describes either (1) the required connection between development projects and improvements sought; or (2) the direct relationship between the impact created by a project and the project-specific fee sought to be imposed on an ad hoc basis. The fee shall not include the costs attributable to existing deficiencies in public facilities, but includes the costs attributable to the increased demand for public facilities reasonably related to the development project in order to (1) refurbish existing facilities to maintain the existing level of service; or (2) achieve an adopted level of service that is consistent with the general plan. The board of supervisors shall establish the amount of such fee via board resolution at a publicly noticed meeting after completion of an adequate nexus study, commissioned by a district seeking establishment of the fee. The nexus study shall establish a reasonable development fee for the district and demonstrate by competent analysis the reasonable relationship between such fee and the impacts of such development, satisfying the statutory requirements for fees for development projects contained in Chapter 5, Division 1, Title 7 of the Government Code Section 66000 et seq. These fees may from time to time be amended as circumstances warrant by the adoption of a superseding resolution by the board of supervisors.

It is the purpose of this chapter to establish parameters for proof of ground water as it pertains to land development. With the exception of the East San Joaquin Ground Water Basin and Tertiary Calaveras River Channel System, ground water availability within the county is largely dependent upon the development of ""hard rock"" wells. These wells tap water from fracture patterns as well as faults and changes in stratigraphy (arrangement of strata). Due to the fact that ground water availability is geologically dependent, well production can and does vary greatly from one site to another. This chapter is established to assist in identification of ground water availability as it pertains to land development, although there can be no guarantee of the continued availability of an adequate and potable water supply once initial parameters of this chapter have been met.

A. Size of Subdivision. Only the payment of fees may be required in subdivisions containing fifty parcels or less. However, the dedication of land may be required for condominium, stock cooperative, and community apartment projects, as defined in Section 1351 of the Civil Code, that exceed fifty dwelling units even though the number of parcels may be less than fifty. B. Exemptions. The following projects are exempt from the provisions of this chapter: 1. Nonresidential Property. Subdivision parcels not used for residential purposes provided the subject properties have commercial, industrial or other nonresidential zoning at the time of the subdivision. For purposes of this section, ""nonresidential zoning"" is defined as C1, C2, M1, M2, PS, REC, AP, A1, GF, TP, or equivalent zoning as indicated in Title 17 of the Calaveras County Code. 2. Affordable Housing. For projects containing affordable housing units as qualified by subsections (B)(2)(a), (b) and (c) of this section, the park land dedication will be reduced by the number of affordable units up to a maximum of twenty percent of the total project units. To qualify for this credit, the affordable housing units shall be rented, leased, sold, conveyed or otherwise transferred: a. To a ""lower income household"" or ""very low-income household"" (Sections 50079.5 and 50105, California Health and Safety Code); b. At a rental or purchase price that does not exceed the ""affordable housing cost"" (Section 50052.5, California Health and Safety Code); c. Under an agreement that guarantees all of the units are maintained for lower and very low-income households as units for rent or sale or transfer, for the lesser of a period of thirty years or the actual life or existence of the structure. The applicant must execute the transfer agreement in the form of a deed restriction, second trust deed, or other legally binding and enforceable document acceptable to the county counsel and binding on the owner and any successor-in-interest to the real property being developed. 3. Multi-Story Apartments. Condominium projects or stock cooperatives that consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment building that is more than five years old when no new dwelling units are added. 4. Private Recreational Facilities. For common interest developments, a maximum credit of twenty percent of the required dedication will be credited against private recreational facilities within the project. Common interest developments are defined in Civil Code Section 1351(c) and include the following: a. Community apartment projects; b. Condominium projects; c. Planned developments; d. Stock cooperatives. 5. Any other subdivision exempted by the Map Act Section 66477. (Ord. 2936 § 3(part), 2008). ",Calaveras_County,529,Calaveras_County.pdf,586

A. General. It is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare, and safety require that two and one-half usable acres of property for each one thousand persons residing within this county be dedicated by the proponent of the subdivision for neighborhood, community and regional parks and trails for recreational purposes. B. Requirements. The requirements of this section shall be satisfied by the dedication of land, payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or both, at the option of the county, for park or recreational purposes. The dedicated land and/or fees shall be used for acquiring and developing new facilities and rehabilitating existing facilities in such a manner that their locations bear a reasonable relationship to their use by the future inhabitants of the subdivision making the dedication. Lands to be dedicated for park and/or recreational purposes shall be suitable in the opinion of the planning director or his/her designee in location, topography, environmental characteristics and development potential as related to the intended use. Principal considerations shall be given to lands that offer: 1. Recreational potential for all age groups; 2. Recreational opportunities provided and maintained in a manner that shall permit the maximum use and enjoyment by all county residents; 3. The possibility for expansion or connection with school grounds; 4. Integration with hiking, riding and bicycle trails, natural stream reserves and other open space; 5. Coordination with all other park systems; 6. Access to at least one existing or proposed public street; 7. Land and facilities for the activity of ""recreational community gardening,"" as that term is defined in Government Code Section 66477(f) is a park and recreation purpose. C. Formula for Dedication of Lands. The amount of acreage required to be dedicated by a residential subdivider for park and recreational purposes shall be based upon the expected number of dwelling units in the subdivision and the density of people per dwelling derived from the most recent federal, state or county population and housing data. The required dedication shall be computed using the following formula: A= 2.5 (DU x DF) / 1000 Where: A= Acres of park land to be dedicated or appraised for in-lieu fee payment for the subdivision. 2.5= Number of acres per one thousand people. DU= Number of dwelling units approved in the subdivision. DF= Population density factor 2.49 Detached single-family dwellings 2.64 Attached single-family dwellings 2.03 Duplexes and multifamily dwellings less than 4 units 2.34 Multifamily dwellings with 5 or more units 2.19 Mobile homes D. Standard Improvements. Whenever real property is being dedicated for park purposes within the project site, the subdivider shall, as a condition for the approval of the tentative map, be obligated to provide curbs, gutters, sidewalks, drainage facilities, street lighting, stop lights, street signs, matching pavement and/or street trees to county standards, stubbing in utility services to the park facility, and all standard improvements required by the county for residential subdivisions plus initial on-site grading required for developing the park facility. In lieu of making said improvements and upon approval by the board of supervisors, the subdivider may pay a sum as estimated by the director of public works sufficient to cover the cost of said standard improvements.

A. Criteria for Requiring Dedication of Both Land and Fees. In subdivisions over fifty parcels, the county may require the subdivider to dedicate both land and fees. 1. Determination of Land or Fees. Whether the county accepts a land dedication or elects fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by the following criteria: a. The compatibility of dedication with the general plan, Calaveras County parks and recreation plan, community plans and other relevant plans; b. The amount of land available; c. The topography, geology, access, size, shape, location and suitability of the land in the subdivision available for dedication; d. Feasibility of dedication; e. Availability of previously acquired park property; f. Accessibility of the park land to the general public; and g. The approximate time when development of the park or recreation facility shall commence. 2. Land and Fees. A requirement for both park land dedication and fee payment shall comply with the following standards: a. When only a portion of the land to be subdivided is proposed in the general plan or applicable specific plan as the site for a recreational facility, that portion shall be dedicated for recreational purposes and a fee computed according to subsection B of this section shall be paid for any additional land that would have been required under Section 16.24.030(C). b. When a major part of the local park or recreational site has been acquired by the county and only a small portion of land is needed from the subdivision to complete the site, the remaining portion of the required dedication shall be dedicated as a fee. This fee shall be computed under subsection B of this section and be paid in an amount equal to the value of the land that would have been required by Section 16.24.030(C). The fees shall be used for the improvement of the existing park or recreational facilities serving the subdivision. 3. The dedication of land for parks and recreational purposes shall not be deemed to waive any other requirements that may be imposed by the county. B. Determining Fees in Lieu of Land. The fee shall equal the acreage of park land obligation derived from the formula in Section 16.24.030(C), less the amount of park land offered for dedication by the subdivider, times the average per-acre fair market value for the appropriate park planning area, plus twenty percent toward the cost of standard improvements (subsection D of this section). 1. The fair market value of the land shall be determined by a licensed real estate appraiser that has been selected and retained by the county at the expense of the subdivider. The fair market value of the land shall be based on the average acre value of the property to be subdivided at the time of the recording of the final subdivision map, adjusted to reflect the value of the property including any required park infrastructure improvements to be installed as a condition on the map. Such appraisal shall exclude improvement. The date of value of the property for purposes of the appraisal shall be within sixty days of payment of the fee as referenced in subsection G of this section. 2. If the subdivider objects to the fair market value as determined by the appraiser, the subdivider may retain, at his or her own expense, another licensed real estate appraiser to complete a second appraisal. If the county disputes the fair market value determined by the second appraiser, the matter shall be submitted to binding arbitration at the expense of the subdivider. 3. If the proposed subdivision contains four or fewer parcels excluding any remainder parcel, the CDD shall determine the fair market value of the property to be subdivided based upon the fair market value of adjacent parcels and the site characteristics of the property. If the subdivider objects to the determination of the CDD, the subdivider may retain, at his or her own expense, a licensed appraiser to provide the fair market value of the property to be subdivided. In the event the CDD determination of the land value exceeds the appraiser's value by more than five thousand dollars, the average of both determinations shall be established as the fair market value. C. Additional Cost for In-Lieu Fees. When the requirements of this section are met solely on the basis of the payment of a fee in lieu of land dedication, in addition to the in-lieu fee, the subdivider shall also pay an amount equal to twenty percent of the in-lieu fee to offset the costs of any required curbs, gutters, drainage facilities, street lighting, stop lights, sidewalks, street signs, matching pavement and street trees to full county standards, stubbing in utility services to the park facility, and all standard improvements required by the county for residential subdivision. D. Credit for Improvements. If the subdivider provides park and recreational improvements on dedicated land, the value of the improvements together with any installed equipment shall be a credit against the required fees or land. Credit for improvements shall only be granted according to the criteria in subsection A of this section, ""Criteria for Requiring Dedication of Both Land and Fees."" E. Suitability of Land to be Dedicated. Each park site proposed for dedication in compliance with this section shall be physically suited for the intended use. 1. Land made part of a park site for subdivision design purposes that is physically unsuited for park use shall not be considered when calculating the area of the park site provided in compliance with this section. The park space provided shall be calculated from the road rights-of-way and interior property lines abutting the site, and not from any abutting roadway centerline. 2. Land intended for active recreation on sport fields shall have a maximum slope of three percent. If necessary, the site shall be graded by the subdivider to achieve this slope in compliance with plans approved by the county. No financial credit shall be given for the cost of grading. 3. If the site to be dedicated is to remain in its natural state, credit against the park land dedication will be related to the grade as follows. Greater credit for sites in excess of three percent grade may be granted at the sole discretion of the CDD if the site has exceptional visual, biotic, or other natural resources. These sites may be developed with pedestrian, bicycle and equestrian trails, interpretive trails, scenic vistas, wildlife viewing and/or community gardens.

If the county determines that any of the land proposed to be dedicated is not suitable for park use, it may reject all or any portion of the land offered and, in that event, the subdivider shall instead pay a fee in compliance with subsection B of this section. E. Procedure for Determining Land or Fee. The CDD shall determine if the project requires dedication of land, payment of in-lieu fees, or a combination of both, based on the criteria in subsection A of this section ""Criteria for Requiring Dedication of Both Land and Fees."" This determination shall be incorporated as a recommended condition on the tentative map. The decision of the approving authority for the tentative map, whether it be the planning commission or the board of supervisors, as to whether land shall be dedicated, a fee shall be charged, or a combination thereof, shall be final. F. Use of Fees. Funds received for park land dedications shall be maintained in a separate interest-bearing account and the principal and interest shall be used for the purchase and development of public park and recreation facilities. These funds shall be committed to the partial or full completion of necessary purchases or improvements within five years after payment or the issuance of building permits on one-half of the parcels created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. If the money is not committed, the principal, without interest, shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of each parcel bears to the total area of all parcels in the subdivision. Any requests for refunds shall be submitted to the CDD. G. Conveyance of Land and Payment of Fees. Real property being dedicated for park purposes shall be conveyed by the subdivider by the parcel or final map in a manner deemed suitable to the county. The land shall be free and clear of all encumbrances except those which, in the opinion of county counsel, shall not interfere with use of the property for park and recreational purposes, and which the board agrees to accept. Required fees shall be deposited with the county at the time of submittal of a parcel or final map. The fees shall be held by the county until the map is recorded, or the time for recordation expires. The subdivider shall provide all fees and instruments required to convey the land including title insurance approved by county counsel in favor of the county in an amount equal to the value of the land. H. Reimbursement Agreements. Nothing in this chapter will prevent the county from entering into a reimbursement agreement with the applicant for that portion of the value of a park land dedication that exceeds their requirement.

Title 17 - ZONING,Chapter 17.02 - Interpretation of the zoning code,17.02.030 - Rules of measurement.,"Calaveras_County | Title 17 - ZONING | Chapter 17.02 - Interpretation of the zoning code | 17.02.030 - Rules of measurement.
For all calculations, the applicant shall be responsible for supplying drawings illustrating the measurements that apply to a project. These drawings shall be drawn to scale and of sufficient detail to allow easy verification upon inspection by the director. A. Fractions. Whenever this zoning code requires consideration of distances, parking spaces, dwelling units, or other aspects of development or the physical environment expressed in numerical quantities, and the result of a calculation contains a fraction of a whole number, the results will be rounded as follows: 1. General Rounding. Fractions exceeding one-half (0.5) or greater shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number and fractions equal to or less than one-half (0.5) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, except as otherwise provided. 2. Exception for State Affordable Housing Density Bonus. The calculation of fractions related to permitted bonus density units for projects eligible for bonus density pursuant to Government Code Section 65915 or any successor statute, shall be rounded up to the next whole number. B. Measuring Distances. 1. Measurements are Shortest Distance. When measuring a required distance, such as the minimum distance between a structure and a lot line, the measurement is made at the closest or shortest distance between the two objects. 2. Distances are Measured Horizontally. When determining distances for setbacks and structure dimensions, all distances are measured along a horizontal plane from the appropriate line, edge of building, structure, storage area, parking area, or other object. These distances are not measured by following the topography or slope of the land. 3. Measurements Involving a Structure. Measurements involving a structure are made to the closest support element of the structure. Structures or portions of structures that are entirely underground are not included in measuring required distances. See also Section 17.16.080, Setbacks. 4. Measurement of Vehicle Stacking or Travel Areas. Measurement of a minimum travel distance for vehicles, such as driveways, are measured down the center of the vehicle travel area. For example, curving driveways and travel lanes are measured along the center arc of the driveway or traffic lane. 5. Measuring Radius. When a specified land use is required to be located a minimum distance from another land use, the minimum distance is measured in a straight line from all points along the lot line of the subject project, in all directions. FIGURE 17.02.030.B: MEASURING DISTANCES C. Measuring Height. Height is measured as the vertical distance from a point on the ground below a structure to a point directly above. 1. Measuring Building Height. Building height is measured from the average base elevation to the highest point on the roof. Average base elevation is determined by taking the elevation of the lowest point at the ground, and the elevation of the highest point at the ground, and finding the average. FIGURE 17.02.030.C.1: MEASURING BUILDING HEIGHT 2. Measuring Height of Fences or Walls. The height of a fence or wall is measured as the vertical distance from the ground level on the lowest external side of the fence or wall to the highest point of such fence or wall. FIGURE 17.02.030.C.2: MEASURING HEIGHT OF FENCES OR WALLS 3. Measuring the Height of Decks. Deck height is determined by measuring from the ground to the top of the floor of the deck directly above the ground below. FIGURE 17.02.030.C.3: MEASURING HEIGHT OF DECKS D. Measuring Lot Width and Depth. 1. Lot Width. Lot width is the horizontal distance between the side lot lines, measured at right angles to the lot along a straight line parallel to the front lot line. 2. Lot Depth. Lot depth is measured along a straight line from the midpoint of the front property line of the lot to the midpoint of the rear property line or to the most distant point on any other lot line where there is no rear lot line. FIGURE 17.02.030.D: MEASURING LOT WIDTH AND DEPTH E. Determining Average Slope. The average slope of a parcel is calculated using the following formula: S = 100(I)(L)/A, where: 1. S = Average slope (in percent) 2. I = Contour interval (in feet) 3. L = Total length of all contour lines on the parcel (in feet) 4. A = Area of subject parcel (in square feet) F. Determining Floor Area. The floor area of a building is the sum of the gross horizontal areas of all floors of a building or other enclosed structure, measured from the outside perimeter of the exterior walls and/or the centerline of interior walls. 1. Included in Floor Area. Floor area includes, but is not limited to, all habitable space (as defined in the California Building Code) that is below the roof and within the outer surface of the main walls of principal or accessory buildings or the centerlines of party walls separating such buildings or portions thereof or within lines drawn parallel to and two feet within the roof line of any building without walls. In the case of a multi-story building that has covered or enclosed stairways, stairwells, or elevator shafts, the horizontal area of such features shall be counted only once at the floor level of their greatest area of horizontal extent. 2. Excluded from Floor Area. Floor area does not include the following: a. Mechanical, electrical, and communication equipment rooms that do not exceed two percent of the building's total floor area; b. Bay windows or other architectural projections where the vertical distance between the lowest surface of the projection and the finished floor is 30 inches or greater; c. Covered porticoes, paseos, corridors, and courtyards designed for use by and accessible to the general public; and d. In non-residential buildings, areas used for off-street parking spaces or loading spaces, driveways, and maneuvering aisles. FIGURE 17.02.030.F: DETERMINING FLOOR AREA G. Determining Floor Area Ratio. The Floor Area Ratio (FAR) is the ratio of the floor area of all primary and accessory buildings on a site to the site area. To calculate the FAR, floor is divided by site area, and typically expressed as a decimal. For example, if the floor area of all buildings on a site totals 20,000 square feet, and the site area is 10,000 square feet, the FAR is expressed as 2.0. FIGURE 17.02.030.G: DETERMINING FLOOR AREA RATIO H. Determining Lot Frontage. 1. Corner Lot. The front of a lot is the narrowest dimension of the lot with street frontage. 2. Through Lot. The front of a through lot abuts the street that neighboring lots use to provide primary access. I. Determining Setbacks. A setback line defining a required setback is parallel to and at the specified distance from the corresponding front, side, or rear property line or other required measuring point. Required setbacks shall be unobstructed from the ground to the sky except where allowed pursuant to Section 17.16.080, Setbacks, subject to compliance with the Building Code. FIGURE 17.02.030.J: DETERMINING SETBACKS J. Measuring Signs. The calculations of measurements related to signs are described in Chapter 17.24, Signs. ",Calaveras_County,545,Calaveras_County.pdf,1553

The purposes of the resource zones are as follows: General Forest (GF) Zone. The GF Zone is intended to provide a resource production zone for commercial timber production and related uses. This zone is compatible with the resource management, resource production, and working lands general plan land use categories. Timber Production (TP) Zone. The purpose of the TP zone is to implement the provisions of the Z'Berg, Warren, Collier Forest Taxation Reform Act as amended and stated in the California Government Code. Lands in the TP Zone are commonly known as timber preserves. Such land is intended for the primary and productive use of timber resources, including timber and wildlife management. While such lands also provide open space this secondary purpose is not to limit or constrain the ability of the property owners to utilize the land in an efficient and productive manner. No development found incompatible with the primary purposes of timber production shall be permitted in the TP zone. This zone is compatible with the resource management, resource production, and working lands general plan land use categories. General Agriculture (A1) Zone. The A1 zone is intended to be the main resource production zone. It is to classify areas for general farming and ranching practices and assign such uses the primary emphasis for the area. It is the purpose of the A1 zone that residential uses are placed in a position of secondary importance when compared to the commercial scale production of food and fiber. This zone is compatible with the resource management, resource production, and working lands general plan land use categories. Agriculture Preserve (AP) Zone. The purpose of the AP zone is to protect and preserve lands for intensive agriculture and ranching production. Agriculture preserve zoning applies to lands for which a Williamson Act contract has been executed. The AP zone may also be utilized for open space protection and preservation under the Williamson Act. All the permitted and conditional uses allowed in the AP zone, when developed and operated in conformance with this title and county rules administering agricultural preserves and Williamson Act Contracts, are determined by the board of supervisors to be compatible with the definition of agricultural, recreational or open space use of the land and thus a use authorized in the AP zone and for lands under a Williamson Act Contract. This zone is compatible with the resource management, resource production, and working lands, rural transition, and rural residential general plan land use categories. Residential Agriculture (RA) Zone. The RA zone is intended to be a zone that accommodates both residential and agricultural uses. The RA zone is to provide lands for small-scale and personal-scale farming and ranching, as well as larger residential parcels. This zone is compatible with the working lands and rural transition general plan land use categories. ",Calaveras_County,552,Calaveras_County.pdf,535

A. Road Maintenance. Road maintenance in resource zones is required as follows. 1. administrative use permit Required for Nonresidential Uses. Any permitted use, beyond that legally existing at the time of adoption of the Ordinance codified in this section, having legal access on or over roads maintained by a county service area, a community service district, a recorded road maintenance agreement or pursuant to Civil Code Section 845, may, to the extent allowed by the grant of access, generate additional traffic on those roads. Prior to commencing any nonresidential permitted use, the proponent of the nonresidential permitted use shall secure an administrative use permit to address the permitted use's road impacts only, unless the proponent can demonstrate that the proposed use will not generate traffic in excess of permitted residential uses. To demonstrate the absence of any additional traffic, the proponent shall estimate the Average Daily Traffic (ADT) that will be generated by the permitted use over a one-month time period. If this estimate indicates that traffic generated by such use is less than the ADT generated by a single-family residence (currently seven and one-half ADT), then an administrative use permit will not be required. 2. Road Maintenance Fee. As a condition of approval of the administrative use permit, the proponent of the use shall be required to pay a road maintenance fee to mitigate the impacts caused by the use. This condition of approval is intended to protect the public health, safety and welfare. Such fees shall be paid as follows: a. The fee shall be calculated based on the ADT of the use divided by the ADT generated by a single-family residence (seven and one-half ADT) and multiplying the annual fee paid by a single-family residence in the area by this proportional factor. Determination of the ADT generated by the use shall be supported by substantial evidence, as approved by the public works department. b. Road maintenance fees for uses having legal access on roads maintained by a county service area shall be paid to t auditor's office and deposited in the appropriate account, as specified in the condition of approval in the administr permit. Evidence of such deposit shall be provided to the planning department prior to the commencement of the c. Road maintenance fees for uses having legal access on roads maintained by a community service district shall be paid to the community service district, as specified in the condition of approval in the administrative use permit. Evidence of such deposit shall be provided to the planning department prior to the commencement of the use. 3. Private Roads. Proponents of uses having legal access over private roads not maintained by the county, or a local agency, shall do one of the following: a. Enter into any existing road maintenance agreement for the road(s) providing access to the use. b. Amend any existing road maintenance agreement to which the proponent of the use is already a party to in order to provide for an additional road maintenance fee for the use. c. If there is no existing road maintenance agreement, record a road maintenance agreement for that portion of the road located on the real property where the use is located. d. Evidence of compliance with any of the above-stated options shall be provided to the planning department prior to the commencement of the use. 4. Enforcement. Failure to obtain an administrative use permit under this section may result in initiation of code compliance proceedings or other remedies, including, but not limited to, the remedies specified in Chapter 17.41, Enforcement, and may require the proponent of the permitted use to pay a road impact fee for the impact caused by the use that was conducted in violation of this section. B. Agricultural preserves, AP Zone. All use of land within the AP Zone shall be developed and operated in conformance with this title and county rules administering agricultural preserves and Williamson Act Contracts. Parcels within an agricultural preserve or Williamson Act contract may be subject to additional use restrictions under the county's Williamson Act program. 1. Use of land of parcels within an agricultural preserve or Williamson Act contract shall be consistent with compatible uses as established by resolution of the board of supervisors, and as amended by subsequent resolution and/or ordinance. 2. Agricultural accessory uses are allowed where no more than three percent of the total land of the agricultural operation or 10 acres, whichever is less, is dedicated to a non-agricultural use. A conditional use permit may be approved to allow additional agricultural accessory uses where the decision maker finds the accessory uses are clearly subordinate to a primary agricultural use on-site and the proposed use conforms with county rules administering agricultural preserves and Williamson Act Contracts. C. TP Zone. The following standards and requirements apply to all land in, or proposed to be within, the TP Zone. 1. Timber Taxation Reform Act. The following requirements authorized by the Timber Taxation Reform Act as amended shall apply: a. All parcels in the TP Zone shall meet the definition of ""timberland"" pursuant to Section 51104 (F) of the California Government Code. b. Use of land within the TP Zone shall be consistent with compatible uses as established by Resolution 76-373 of the board of supervisors, and as amended by subsequent resolution and/or ordinance. c. Upon the effective date of the Ordinance codified in this section, any owner of record may make application to the board of supervisors to zone such land into the TP Zone. d. Application procedures shall be established in this title and California Government Code Section 51113, including the following additional criteria: i. The application shall include a map showing the perimeter boundaries of the parcel(s) to be included in the TP Zone, with all assessor parcel numbers indicated on the map. ii. The application shall include a timber management plan prepared over the signature of a registered professional forester in conformance with the requirements of the board of forestry. iii. The parcel(s) shall meet the requirements of the Forest Practices Act, and if applicable, the requirements of California Public Resources Code Section 4031. iv. The land shall meet the requirements of Section 434 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code, the land area shall be dedicated to the growth, management and production of timber resources, or the land shall be within a program approved by the board of forestry under CFIP. e. Parcels included in the TP Zone shall be zoned as such for a rolling period of ten years from the ordinance effective date. On the first, and all subsequent anniversary dates of the ordinance, the ten-year period shall be extended by one year, unless a notice of cancellation and rezoning is approved as provided in the Act, as amended. 2. Subdivision. Parcels in the TP Zone shall not be subdivided into lots of less than 160 acres unless a finding is substantiated that the timber management plan has been amended to include the proposed new parcels in a plan meeting the requirements of the Act, and further provided that such subdivision and plan amendment are approved by a four-fifths vote of the board of supervisors.

The county recognizes that the extraction of minerals is essential to the continued economic well-being of the county and to the needs of society and that the reclamation of mined lands is necessary to prevent or minimize adverse effects on the environment and to protect the public health and safety. Calaveras County also recognizes that surface mining takes place in diverse areas where the geologic, topographic, climatic, biological, and social conditions are significantly different and that reclamation operations and the specifications therefore may vary accordingly. The purpose and intent of this chapter is to ensure that: A. There is continued availability of important mineral resources, while regulating surface mining operations. B. Adverse environmental effects are prevented or minimized and that mined lands are reclaimed to a usable condition which is readily adaptable for alternative land uses. C. The production and conservation of minerals are encouraged, while giving consideration to values relating to recreation, watershed, wildlife, range and forage, and aesthetic enjoyment. D. Residual hazards to the public health and safety are eliminated. ",Calaveras_County,597,Calaveras_County.pdf,205

""Area of regional significance"" means an area designated by the State Mining and Geology Board which is known to contain a deposit of minerals, the extraction of which is judged to be of prime importance in meeting future needs for minerals in a particular region of the state within which the minerals are located and which, if prematurely developed for alternate incompatible land uses, could result in the premature loss of minerals that are of more than local significance. B. ""Area of statewide significance"" means an area designated by the state mining and geology board which is known to conta deposit of minerals, the extraction of which is judged to be of prime importance in meeting future needs for minerals in th and which, if prematurely developed for alternate incompatible land uses, could result in the permanent loss of minerals t of more than local or regional significance. C. ""Borrow pits"" means excavations created by the surface mining of rock, unconsolidated geologic deposits or soil to provide material (borrow) for fill elsewhere. D. ""Compatible land uses"" means land uses inherently compatible with mining and/or that require a minimum public or private investment in structures, land improvements, and which may allow mining because of the relative economic value of the land and its improvements.

A. To ensure that reclamation will proceed in accordance with the approved reclamation plan, the county shall require as a condition of approval security which will be released upon satisfactory performance. The applicant may pose security in the form of a surety bond, trust fund, irrevocable letter of credit from an accredited financial institution, or other method acceptable to the county and the State Mining and Geology Board as specified in state regulations, and which the county reasonably determines are adequate to perform reclamation in accordance with the surface mining operation's approved reclamation plan. Financial assurances shall be made payable to the county and the State Department of Conservation. B. Financial assurances will be required to ensure compliance with elements of the reclamation plan, including but not limited to, revegetation and landscaping requirements, restoration of aquatic or wildlife habitat, restoration of water bodies and water quality, slope stability and erosion and drainage control, disposal of hazardous materials, and other measures, if necessary. C. Cost estimates for the financial assurance shall be submitted to the planning department for review and approval prior to the operator securing financial assurances. The planning department shall forward a copy of the cost estimates, together with any documentation received supporting the amount of the cost estimates, to the State Department of Conservation for review. If the State Department of Conservation does not comment within forty-five days of receipt of these estimates, it shall be assumed that the cost estimates are adequate, unless the county has reason to determine that additional costs may be incurred. The planning department shall have the discretion to approve the financial assurance if it meets the requirements of this chapter, SMARA, and state regulations. D. The amount of the financial assurance shall be based upon the estimated costs of reclamation for the years or phases stipulated in the approved reclamation plan, including any maintenance of reclaimed areas as may be required, subject to adjustment for the actual amount required to reclaim lands disturbed by surface mining activities since January 1, 1976, and new lands to be disturbed by surface mining activities in the upcoming year. Cost estimates should be prepared by a California registered professional engineer and/or other similarly licensed and qualified professionals retained by the operator and approved by the planning department. The estimated amount of the financial assurance shall be based on an analysis of physical activities necessary to implement the approved reclamation plan, the unit costs for each of these activities, the number of units of each of these activities, and the actual administrative costs. Financial assurances to ensure compliance with revegetation, restoration of water bodies, restoration of aquatic or wildlife habitat, and any other applicable element of the approved reclamation plan shall be based upon cost estimates that include but may not be limited to labor, equipment, materials, mobilization of equipment, administration, and reasonable profit by a commercial operator other than the permittee. A contingency factor of ten percent shall be added to the cost of financial assurances. E. In projecting the costs of financial assurances, it shall be assumed without prejudice or insinuation that the surface mining operation could be abandoned by the operator and, consequently, the county or State Department of Conservation may need to contract with a third party commercial company for reclamation of the site. F. The financial assurances shall remain in effect for the duration of the surface mining operation and any additional period until reclamation is completed (including any maintenance required). G. The amount of financial assurances required of a surface mining operation for any one year shall be adjusted annually to account for new lands disturbed by surface mining operations, inflation, and reclamation of lands accomplished in accordance with the approved reclamation plan. The financial assurances shall include estimates to cover reclamation for existing conditions and anticipated activities during the upcoming year, excepting that the permittee may not claim credit for reclamation scheduled for completion during the coming year. H. Revisions to financial assurances shall be submitted to the planning department each year prior to the anniversary date for approval of the financial assurances. The financial assurance shall cover the cost of existing disturbance and anticipated activities for the next calendar year, including any required interim reclamation. If revisions to the financial assurances are not required, the operator shall explain, in writing, why revisions are not required. ",Calaveras_County,603,Calaveras_County.pdf,840

Title 17 - ZONING,Chapter 17.16 - General Site Regulations,17.16.060 - Historic buildings and structures.,"Calaveras_County | Title 17 - ZONING | Chapter 17.16 - General Site Regulations | 17.16.060 - Historic buildings and structures.
A. Purpose. 1. Calaveras County contains many historic structures that are integral to the history of the county, the central Sierra foothill region, and the state of California, including several buildings that are listed or eligible for listing on national and/or state lists of historic resources. 2. The conservation and open space element of the Calaveras County General Plan adopted in 2019 includes goals, policies, and implementation measures calling for the preservation of the county's historic resources, including but not limited to Implementation Measures COS-8G & 8H. 3. General Plan Implementation Measure COS-8G requires the county to develop a cultural resources management ordinance that includes, among other requirements, the establishment of a county register of historic resources, utilization of the California State Historical Building Code, and a cultural resource study prior to demolition of buildings seventy-five years or older. 4. General Plan Implementation Measure COS-8H requires the use of the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Treatment of Historic Properties (1992) as a guide for evaluating development proposals involving cultural resources. 5. To prevent irreversible destruction of the county's historic resources pending the adoption of a permanent cultural resources management ordinance, this interim ordinance is intended to: a. Serve as the county's interim local register of historically important buildings and structures for purposes of determining what buildings or structures in the county qualify for application of the alternative standards set forth in the State Historical Building Code (California Health and Safety Code §18950 et. seq.) b. Serve as the county's interim local register of historically important buildings and structures for purposes of determining which proposals to demolish such buildings or structures require further review before a demolition permit is issued by the county. c. Set forth interim standards for reviewing and, if applicable, protecting qualifying historical buildings and structures pending the adoption of a permanent ordinance implementing Measures COS-8G and COS-8H of the county's general plan. B. Local Register of Historical Buildings. 1. This section applies to buildings or structures at least seventy-five years old that are either: a. Listed the National Register of Historic Places or the California Register of Historic Places, or b. Have been determined by the state historical resources commission to be eligible for listing in the California Register of Historical Resources. If this subsection applies to a building or structure, that building or structure shall be deemed a ""listed"" building or structure for purposes of this section. 2. The planning director shall be responsible for determining whether a building or structure meets the criteria of Section 17.16.060.B.1. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, any appeal of the planning director's determination under this sec limited to determining whether or not the director correctly identified the building or structure as qualifying under 17.16.060.B.1. C. Additional Review Required for Demolition of Listed Historical Buildings; Application of State Historical Building Code. 1. Prior to issuing a demolition permit, the chief building official shall request the planning director's determination of whether or not the parcel on which the demolition is proposed contains a listed building or structure as described in Section 17.16.060.B. 2. If the parcel contains a listed building or structure as described in Section 17.16.060.B, the chief building official shall not issue a demolition permit until a conditional use permit as described in Section 17.16.060.D has first been approved by the planning commission concerning the proposed demolition activity. 3. If the parcel contains a listed building or structure as described in Section 17.16.060.B, the chief building official shall apply the State Historic Building Code (California Health and Safety Code §18950 et. seq.) to its review of any demolition permit pertaining to that building or structure. D. Limited Scope Conditional Use Permit. 1. Unless the proposed demolition activity is part of a land use project that independently requires a discretionary land use approval by the county, review of the application for a conditional use permit under this section shall be limited to a review of potentially significant impacts to the listed historical building or structure as described in Section 17.16.060.E. 2. If, upon the review described in Section 17.16.060.E, it is determined that carrying out the proposed demolition activity will result in one or more potentially significant impacts to the listed historical building or structure, conditions of approval may be required. 3. If, upon the review described in Section 17.16.060.E, it is determined that conditions of approval will not suffice to reduce the potential impacts to the listed historical building or structure to less than significant, the application may be denied. 4. Review under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and/or the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) prior to approval of a conditional use permit under this section shall, to the extent allowable by law, be limited in scope to reflect the limited scope of discretionary review authorized by this section. CEQA and/or NEPA compliance shall be the responsibility of the planning director. 5. If the proposed demolition activity is part of a land use project that independently requires a discretionary land use approval through the planning department, the planning commission, or other county department, the review required pursuant to this section shall be added to the review required for this other discretionary land use approval and subsection d shall not apply. All discretionary use permit applications that trigger the application of this section shall be processed as conditional use permits under Chapter 17.31 of the county code, with review by the planning commission. 6. Except as otherwise stated in this section, the application, review, and hearing procedures for permits issued under this section shall be the same as those described in Chapter 17.27 of this title. E. Panel Review of Limited Scope Conditional Use Permit Applications Under This Section. 1. After an application for a limited scope conditional use permit under this section has been submitted to the planning department and deemed complete, the application shall be reviewed and reported on within thirty days by a panel consisting of the following: a. The planning director or their designee. b. The chief building official or their designee. c. A designee of the Calaveras County Historical Society. 2. The panel shall be charged with the following tasks, which shall culminate in a written report to the planning director: a. Determine in writing whether the proposed demolition activity will result in one or more potentially significant impacts to the listed historical building or structure pursuant to Section 17.16.060.D. In making this determination, the panel shall utilize the significance criteria described in 14 Cal. Code Regs. Sections 15064.5(b)1—3. b. If potentially significant impacts are identified pursuant to Section 17.16.060.E.2.a, describe them in writing. c. If potentially significant impacts are identified pursuant to Section 17.16.060.E.2.a, the panel shall describe in writing what, if any, requirements or conditions can be feasibly imposed as a condition of the county's approval of the proposed activity that will reduce impacts to the point of insignificance. i. In developing these requirements and conditions, the panel shall consider the guidelines in the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Treatment of Historic Properties (1992). ii. The panel shall not impose conditions that exceed those necessary to reduce the identified impacts to the point of insignificance. iii. If the panel identifies more than one potential condition that could feasibly be imposed to reduce an identified impact to the point of insignificance, the panel shall present these as options that the applicant may choose from. iv. A requirement or condition that would result in a violation of this title or of other local, state, or federal laws, ordinances, or regulations, including but not limited to the State Historical Building Code, cannot be feasibly imposed. d. State in writing whether or not the imposition of the requirements or conditions described in Section 17.16.060.E.2.c will mitigate all identified impacts to the point of insignificance. 3. After receiving the panel's report, the planning director shall develop and submit their recommendations for CEQA compliance and permit issuance to the planning commission for review. The staff report developed for the planning commission hearing on the limited scope conditional use permit shall include the report of the panel described in Section 17.16.060.E.1. F. Planning Commission Review Of Limited Scope Conditional Use Permit. 1. The planning commission shall not approve the limited scope conditional use permit without: a. A finding that CEQA has been complied with. b. A finding that the approval of the permit is consistent with the general plan and any applicable community plan. c.

A finding that the commission has read and considered the report prepared by the review panel pursuant to county code Section 17.16.060.E. e. An explanation of what conditions of approval, if any, will be imposed and why they are required to reduce potential impacts to the historical characteristics of the building or structure to the point of insignificance. 2. Conditions of project approval shall be limited to those measures or requirements that are necessary to reduce or eliminate the impacts to the historical characteristics of the building or structure as described in this section. No conditions shall be imposed for which there is not a reasonable relationship between the condition and the direct effects of the project on the historical characteristics of the building or structure. 3. The planning commission's determination shall be final unless timely appealed to the board of supervisors pursuant to 17.27.140 of this title. G. Nuisance Declared; Revocation; Enforcement; Abatement Costs; Fines. 1. Failure to comply with this section is unlawful in all zones and constitutes a public nuisance that may be abated as described in Chapter 8.06 of the county code. 2. The planning director may revoke a permit issued under this section at any time that there has been noncompliance with one or more of the provisions of this section and/or the conditions of the permit. The county's written determinations shall be served by mail to the last permittee address provided by the permittee, with a statement of factual and/or legal reasons for the determination. If the owner of the property on which the building or structure at issue exists is not the applicant, a copy of this determination shall also be sent to the owner of the property. Permit revocation is not required prior to the county taking action to enforce violations. 3. Inspections of the building or structure at issue and the surrounding premises and grounds may be conducted by the planning director, the chief building official, or their designees during business hours to investigate the condition of the building or structure at issue, the feasibility of potential permit conditions, and to ensure ongoing compliance with this section and permit conditions. Such inspections may be conducted without prior notice and may be conducted prior to the permit being granted. Failure to consent to the inspection may result in the county seeking an inspection warrant from the superior court. 4. Whenever any county enforcement official determines that a public nuisance as described in this section exists within the unincorporated county, he or she is authorized to utilize the enforcement, abatement, cost recovery, and administrative hearing provisions described in Chapter 8.06 of the county code, including, as necessary, the summary abatement provisions of that chapter. The county shall also have the right to utilize any injunction, enforcement, cost recovery, abatement or other administrative, criminal or civil remedy available to the county under applicable laws, including but not limited to all available civil, criminal and administrative remedies. 5. In any enforcement action brought to enforce the provisions of this section, each parcel owner, permittee, and/or occupant who causes, permits, allows, or maintains activities in violation of this section shall be jointly and severally liable for all resulting administrative fines and for any and all actual costs of enforcement incurred by the county, including all allowable attorneys' fees, in the event the county brings and prevails in any administrative proceeding, civil suit, or any other action to enforce the provisions of this section. If the parcel owner is not the occupant, the parcel owner is responsible to notify the occupant of the requirements of this section and to require their compliance. 6. Each activity that violates this section shall be an infraction. Each day that a violation of this section continues unabated shall constitute an independent violation. Every violation shall be punishable as a ""local building and safety code"" violation as described in Government Code Section 25132(c). Fines imposed for a second or additional violation of this section within a one-year period shall be reduced to two hundred dollars for a second violation or five hundred dollars for an additional violation only if the chief building official, upon receiving a written request for a hardship waiver by the responsible party accompanied by all supporting documentation, makes the following findings: a. The responsible party has made a bona fide effort to comply after the first violation, and b. Payment of the full amount of the fine would impose an undue financial burden on the responsible party. H. Duration; Renumbering. 1. This section shall remain in effect until it is replaced with a permanent cultural resource management ordinance as described in General Plan Implementation Measure COS-8G or until it otherwise expires as required by law. 2.

The board of supervisors hereby finds and declares: A. Adequate supplies of water are vital to the economy of the county and the health and well-being of its citizens. B. The ground water underlying the county has been and will continue to be an important source of water for the people and lands of the county for agricultural, domestic, municipal, and other purposes. C. Under California case law, water may be appropriated from a ground water basin if the ground water supply is surplus and exceeds the reasonable and beneficial needs of overlying users. D. It is essential for the protection of the health, welfare, and safety of the residents of the county, that the ground water resources of the county be protected from harm resulting from the extraction of ground water for use on lands outside of the county until such time as needed additional surface water supplies are obtained for use on lands of the county, or as further and more accurate quantification of ground water resources within the county is developed and ground water management plans for affected basins have been adopted. E. California courts have recognized and upheld the ability of counties, through the exercise of their police powers, to regulate ground water extraction and transfer from basins within their boundaries. See, e.g., Baldwin, et al. Tehama county (1994) I Cal. App. 4th 166. F. Because of the need for increased water supply to meet future needs within the county, and because surface water supplies obtained in the future may be used conjunctively with available local ground water for reasonable and beneficial local uses, it is vital that the county's ground water supply and quantity be preserved. G. It is essential for information gathering and monitoring purposes, and for the protection of the county's ground water resources, that the county adopt a permit process addressing the extraction of ground water for use outside the county, or in place of surface water used similarly. In adopting and codifying this chapter, the county does not intend to limit other authorized means of managing the county ground water and intends to work cooperatively with interested local public agencies to further develop and implement joint ground water management practices.

The area of a sign shall be calculated by enclosing the extreme limits of framing, emblem, logo, representation, letters applied to the structure without a distinctive background (e.g., channel letter), or other display within a maximum of two squares and/or rectangles. Supporting structures, such as bases and columns, are not included in sign area provided that they contain no lettering or graphics. See Figure 17.24.050: Sign Area Measurement. FIGURE 17.24.050: SIGN AREA MEASUREMENT A. Single-Faced Signs. The sign area of a sign with a single face area is the area of the sign face. B. Double-Faced Signs. Where two faces of a double-faced sign are located two feet or less from one another at all points or located at an interior angle of forty-five degrees or less from one another, the sign area of double-faced signs is computed as the area of one face. Where the two faces are not equal in size, the larger sign face will be used. Where two faces of a double-faced sign are located more than two feet or greater than forty-five degrees from one another, both sign faces are counted toward sign area. FIGURE 17.24.050.B: MEASURING DOUBLE-FACED SIGNS C. Multi-Faced Signs. On a multi-faced sign, where at least one interior angle is forty-five degrees or less, the area of two faces (the largest and smallest face) must be summed to determine sign area. In all other situations involving a sign with three or more sides, sign area will be calculated as the sum of all faces. FIGURE 17.24.050.C: MEASURING MULTI-FACED SIGNS D. Three-Dimensional Signs. Signs that consist of, or have attached to them, one or more three-dimensional objects (i.e., balls, cubes, clusters of objects, sculpture, or statue-like trademarks), may have a sign area that is the sum of all areas using the four vertical sides of the smallest rectangular prism that will encompass the sign.

Title 17 - ZONING,Chapter 17.25 - Standards for speci c uses,17.25.190 - Special events.,"Calaveras_County | Title 17 - ZONING | Chapter 17.25 - Standards for speci c uses | 17.25.190 - Special events.
The purpose of a special event permit is to provide for a review process to consider activities or uses which may be compatible with other permitted uses within a zone district, but due to their nature may have an impact on the environment or the public health, safety and welfare of the community. Special event permits require consideration of site design, adjacent land uses, availability of public infrastructure and services, and environmental impacts, based on the specific location of any proposed activity or use requiring such a permit. It is not the intent of this review process to regulate conduct, the sole or principal object of which is the expression, dissemination or communication by verbal, visual, literary or auditory means of opinion, views or ideas which are protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article 1, Section 2 of the California Constitution. A. Special Events, Defined. Special events are organized activities, assembly, or events to which the public is invited to watch, listen or participate, and for which compensation may be made, for the use of the site and facilities if held on private property. Special events are subject to the requirements of this section. B. Where Allowed. Special events are allowed as an accessory use to a primary use on-site as follows. Special events that are not accessory to an on-site primary use are considered event centers (see Section 17.42.030) and subject to the standards and requirements for event centers included in this title. 1. A1 and AP Zones. Special events are allowed as a secondary use to an on-site farm as defined in Section 52262 of the Food and Agricultural Code provided no more than three percent of the total land or ten acres, whichever is less, is used subject to the following permit requirements: a. Up to twelve special events may be held in a calendar year as a permitted use. b. Thirteen to twenty-four special events, held during a calendar year requires an administrative use permit. c. Over twenty-four special events, held during a calendar year requires a conditional use permit. 2. Other Zones. In all zones other than A1 and AP, special events are allowed as secondary uses to an established primary use, pursuant to the allowances, requirements, and permit requirements of this section. C. Permit Required. 1. Special events may be held on any lands located within the unincorporated boundaries of the county, subject to approval and validation of the appropriate use permit, except as provided in Sections 17.25.190.B.1.a and 17.25.190.D. 2. It is unlawful for any person to hold, engage in, or conduct, within the unincorporated boundaries of the county, any special event subject to the provisions of this title and not expressly exempt hereunder without having first obtained a valid permit and without having first complied with all applicable provisions of this section. 3. The planning director, planning commission, or board of supervisors, as applicable, are authorized to issue permits for special events pursuant to the procedures established in this section. 4. A copy of the county approved permit shall be kept on site at the venue of the special event and shall be made available for review by any county official upon request. 5. Compliance with the provisions of this title does not exempt the holder of a permit from compliance with all other provisions of the county code or any other federal, state or local law or regulation. D. Exemptions. The following special events are exempt from this section: 1. A parade covered by an approved road closure permit, which is not held in conjunction with a larger event. 2. Funeral processions by a licensed mortuary or funeral home. 3. Special events held in existing legal theaters, meeting halls, or other public assembly facilities and public parks where the event complies with all applicable state, federal and local laws and regulations, where there is adequate parking and the number of attendees or type of events does not require additional emergency or security personnel to be present. 4. Special events held at the county fairground facilities, where the event complies with all applicable state, federal and local laws and regulations, where there is adequate parking and the number of attendees or type of events does not require additional emergency or security personnel to be present, as determined by the county Sheriff. 5. Live music in conjunction with a restaurant, cafe, pub, tavern, bar or tasting room subject to Chapter 9.02, Noise Control, of the Calaveras County Code, and subject to any limitation on the number of attendees as set forth in the Zoning District for the property on which the use occurs. 6. Any school event on a school campus including but not limited to athletic events, school dances, rallies, educational assemblies, etc. 7. Lawful picketing or demonstrations on private property or public sidewalks or other public rights-of-ways owned or controlled by the county so long as application of traffic regulations, laws or controls are complied with. 8.

Although not required to obtain a permit for an activity exempted pursuant to this subsection, an event organizer is required to comply with general regulations governing public and environmental health and safety and all other applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. 10. Events that are in compliance with Section 17.25.080.H, Recurring and Historical Events. E. Similar events. When a special event is not specifically listed in this section, the planning director shall determine whether the special event is similar in nature to listed special events and shall establish the appropriate permit required. F. Type of Permit Required. 1. Temporary Use Permit. A special event that would require a temporary use permit is a one-time special event with no impact to the environment, adjacent property, the neighborhood and the community and does not require interdepartmental routing for review and conditions by other county departments. Special events subject to a temporary use permit are typically self-contained on a single property, not requiring additional county services and/or any other event that the planning director determines to meet the requirement of needing a temporary use permit. These types of events would qualify to be exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act. 2. Administrative Use Permit. A special event that would require an administrative use permit is one that would have limited or less than significant impact to the environment, on adjacent property, the neighborhood or community and would require interdepartmental routing and conditions of approval outside of the standard conditions placed on a temporary use permit. Events characterized as needing this type of permit qualify for an exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act and may include, but are not limited to carnivals, parades, car shows, pedestrian or bicycle races, and craft exhibits or bazaars. An administrative use permit can be issued for a one-time event that does not qualify for a Temporary Use Permit, as well as multiple events for the same location, that occur at various times throughout the year. 3. Conditional Use Permit. A special event that would require a conditional use permit is one that could have the potential to cause effects on the environment or adversely impact adjacent property, the neighborhood or the community. It would require interdepartmental and/or outside agency routing. These types of events are characterized as having a large attendance, routinely occurring on a yearly basis, and include, but are not limited to music or concert festivals, overnight festivals and year round markets. These types of events may not be exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act and require a more detailed environmental review. Special event conditional use permits are also subject to the provisions of Chapter 17.31, conditional use permits. G. Development and Operational Standards. 1. Any person or entity desiring to conduct a special event for which a special event permit is required, shall file an application with the planning department per the following timeframe: a. Temporary Use Permit. Thirty calendar days prior to the special event. b. Administrative Use Permit. Thirty calendar days prior to the special event. c. Conditional Use Permit. Six months prior to the special event. 2. All applications shall be completed on a county application form and contain at a minimum all of the following information: a. The name of the applicant, the sponsoring organization, the approval of the sponsoring organization for the applicant to apply for the permit on its behalf, the special event organizer who promotes and manages the special event, if any, and the mailing addresses, e-mail addresses and telephone numbers of each, and the proposed date, time, duration and location of the special event. b. Property owner authorization. c. If applicable, the proposed location of the parade assembly and disbanding areas, the route to be traveled, and the parade assembly starting and ending times. d. The nature and purpose of the special event and a description of all of the equipment and planned activities, including, without limitation, all of the following: i. The sale, distribution, donation, or collection of any merchandise, food, beverages, or services; ii. Cooking of food or open fires; iii. The sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages; iv.

The approximate number of anticipated special event participants, which includes, without limitation, spectators, staff, volunteers, security personnel, first aid and medical services personnel. f. The plan to accommodate vehicle and bicycle parking by participants, including parking for the disabled, of on-street parking, and a parking shuttle plan, if applicable. For special events in parks, whether vehicle access into the park is requested, the number of vehicles, the planned path of travel, and whether the vehicle(s) will remain in the park overnight. For special events that will involve temporary street, alley, or sidewalk closures, or temporary on-street parking restrictions, a traffic control and/or parking management plan consistent with the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways may be required. g. An event site plan to identify locations and number of all equipment and facilities including, without limitation, temporary fencing, temporary structures, staging, bleachers, portable restrooms and hand washing stations, cooking facilities, tables and chairs, waste and recycling containers, electrical and water sources and connections, fuel storage, emergency medical service area(s), pyrotechnic devices or fireworks, carnival and animal rides, and specialized recreational equipment. The site plan shall also identify the paths for access by participants, vehicles and emergency vehicles, and the area(s) for the sale or consumption of alcoholic beverages, if applicable. h. Whether the special event will involve the use of amplified sound, the type, location, and direction of the amplified sound, and the type of amplified sound equipment. i. For parades, an estimate of the maximum parade length; the total number of bands, sound vehicles or musical units, if any, their type and number of members in each unit; the total number of marching units, if any, their type and the number of members in each unit; the number of animals, if any, and type; the number of floats, if any, their size, type and how powered; and the space between the units and floats and their speed. j. Any other information which the county deems to be necessary to process the permit. 3. All special events shall adhere to the following operational standards: a. All events shall comply with the noise standards set forth in Chapter 9.02 Noise Control, of the Calaveras County Code. b. Parking must be onsite. If an event exceeds the onsite capacity, a parking plan is required.

Event hours shall be 7:00 a.m. - 10:00 p.m. for Temporary and administrative use permit; hours for an event that requires a conditional use permit will be determined during the review process. 4. Any changes to the application including, without limitation, an increase in the number of participants, and any additional vehicles, equipment, or activities, shall be submitted in writing not later than ten days before the date of the special event. H. Recurring and Historical Events. Recurring community events that have been lawfully and historically held in the county on a regular basis for at least five years shall obtain a Master administrative use permit to comply with the provisions of this section. I. Insurance and Indemnity Requirements. 1. Evidence of general liability insurance coverage for special events requiring an administrative use permit or temporary use permit shall be furnished to the county prior to approval or a permit. The county shall be named as an additional insured on the policy, at no cost to the county if the event is to be held on county owned property. 2. All special event permit applications shall be subject to the requirements of Section 17.27.030.B.1, Application Forms, and may also require evidence of general liability insurance coverage as set forth above in subsection A, depending on the type and duration of the special event. J. Permit Denial. 1. Permits for special events may be denied upon findings that approving the permit would have an impact to the environment that cannot be mitigated or is contrary to the public health, safety, or welfare for one of the following reasons: a. The time and duration of street closures and parking restrictions will unduly interfere with the operation of businesses, schools, hospitals, churches, or other private, public or quasi-public institutions located in close proximity to the proposed special event site and the applicant is unable or unwilling to modify the special event size, location, date, time, or duration to minimize such interference; or b. The time, duration, and frequency of the use of amplified sound would unduly interfere with the residents' quiet enjoyment of their property for an extended and unreasonable period of time, and the applicant is unable or unwilling to modify the special event size, location, time or duration to minimize such interference. 2. Approving the permit would be contrary to the public health, safety, or welfare for one of the following reasons: a. The special event will unduly interfere with ingress to, egress from, or travel on a state designated highway or county road. b. The special event requires a temporary street closure which will unduly interfere with the orderly and safe movement of traffic, the provision of public services such as transit services or emergency police and fire services, and the applicant is unable or unwilling to modify the special event size, location, date, time or duration to minimize such interference. c. The special event will require a significant diversion of sheriff's, fire and paramedic personnel such that protection for other areas of the county may be adversely impacted and the applicant is unable or unwilling to modify the special event size, location, date, time or duration to minimize such impact. d. The anticipated number of special event participants would exceed the capacity of the streets, sidewalks, alleys, parks, or available parking, thereby creating public health and safety concerns. e. The assembly to occupy all or any portion of a public street, sidewalk, alley, or park would detract from the use facilities for their intended and ordinary purposes and the special event activities, location, date, time, or durat adversely impact the surrounding neighborhood. 3. Applications for a special event permit may be denied if the applicant or the sponsoring organization was issued a citation within the prior year period for failure to obtain a special event permit or for violation of the permit conditions and the citation fees or liens have yet to be paid. K. Revocation. 1. An administrative use permit or a Temporary Use Permit for special events may be revoked for any of the following reasons: a. The applicant, after receiving a permit, fails or refuses to inform the county of the significant changes to the special event from what was set out in the application, has submitted false or misleading information as part of the application, fails to comply with a permit condition, or fails to obtain or comply with any other required county, state or local permit; b. A significant number of the participants expected to attend the special event have made it known that they have a specific intent, manifested by specific plans, to engage in or provoke violence or criminal activity. 2.

Telecommunications facilities shall not interfere with public safety radio communications. 8. Co-location. The applicant and owner of any site on which a telecommunication facility is located shall cooperate and exercise good faith in co-locating telecommunication facilities on the same support structures or site. Good faith shall include sharing technical information to evaluate the feasibility of co-location, and may include negotiations for erection of a replacement support structure to accommodate co-location. A competitive conflict to co-location or financial burden caused by sharing information normally will not be considered as an excuse to the duty of good faith. a. All facilities shall make available unused space for co-location of other telecommunication facilities, including space for these entities providing similar, competing services. Co-location is not required if the host facility can demonstrate that the addition of the new service or facilities would impair existing service or cause the host to go offline for a significant period of time. In the event a dispute arises as to whether a permittee has exercised good faith in accommodating other users, the director may require the applicant to obtain a third-party technical study at applicant's expense. The director may review any information submitted by applicant and permittee(s) in determining whether good faith has been exercised. b. All co-located and multiple-user telecommunication facilities shall be designed to promote facility and site sharing. Telecommunication towers and necessary appurtenances, including but not limited to parking areas, access roads, utilities and equipment buildings, shall be shared by site users whenever possible. c. No co-location may be required where it can be shown that the shared use would or does result in significant interference in the broadcast or reception capabilities of the existing telecommunication facilities or failure of the existing facilities to meet federal standards for emissions. d. Failure to comply with co-location requirements when feasible or cooperate in good faith as provided for in this section shall result in denial of a permit request or revocation of an existing permit. 9. Fire Prevention, Defensible Space. In addition to all other applicable building and fire safety requirements, telecommunication facilities shall comply with Public Resources Code Section 4291 for defensible space. 10. Surety Bond. As a condition of approval, an applicant for a building permit to erect or install a telecommunication facility shall be required to post a cash or surety bond in a form and amount acceptable to county Counsel to cover removal costs of the facility in the event that its use is abandoned or the approval is otherwise terminated. D. Required Findings. 1. General Findings. In approving a telecommunication facility, the review authority shall make the following findings: a. The proposed use conforms with the specific purposes of this section and any special standards applicable to the proposed facility; b. The applicant has made good faith and reasonable efforts to locate the proposed facility on a support structure other than a new ground-mounted antenna, monopole, or lattice tower or to accomplish co-location; c. The proposed site results in fewer or less severe environmental impacts than any feasible alternative site; and d. The proposed facility will not be readily visible or it is not feasible to incorporate additional measures that would make the facility not readily visible. 2. Additional Findings for Facilities Not Co-Located. To approve a telecommunication facility that is not co-located with other existing or proposed facilities the review authority shall find that co-location or siting on an existing structure is not feasible because of technical, aesthetic, or legal considerations including that such co-location or siting: a. Would have more significant adverse effects on views or other environmental considerations; or b. Is not permitted by the property-owner; or c. Would impair the quality of service to the existing facility; or d. Would require existing facilities at the same location to go off-line for a significant period of time. 3. Additional Findings for Setback Reductions. To approve a reduction in setback, the review authority shall make one or more of the following findings: a. The facility will be co-located onto or clustered with an existing, legally established telecommunication facility; and/or b. The reduced setback enables further mitigation of adverse visual and other environmental impacts than would otherwise be possible. 4. Additional Findings for Any Other Exception to Standards. The review authority may waive or modify requirements of this section upon finding that strict compliance would result in noncompliance with applicable federal or State law. E. Vacation and Removal of Facilities. The service provider shall notify the director of the intent to vacate a site at least thirty days prior to the vacation. The operator of a telecommunications facility shall remove all unused or abandoned equipment, antennas, poles, or towers within sixty days of discontinuation of the use and the site shall be restored to its original, pre-construction condition.

This chapter establishes procedures and requirements for considering and entering into legally binding agreements with applicants for development projects, as authorized in Government Code Sections 65864-65869.5, that will assure the county that a proposed project will proceed to its completion in compliance with the plans submitted by the applicant and to guarantee the applicant that the project can proceed to its completion in accordance with the rules and regulations in effect at the time of project approval. Development agreements are intended to accomplish two primary purposes: (1) provide more certainty to a landowner or developer through the grant of vested property rights for an agreed-upon term of years; and in return (2) provide more certainty to the county that public amenities and improvements will be provided according to an agreed-upon schedule and a level of quality sufficient to justify the grant of vested rights. Public benefits arising from a development agreement may include, but are not limited to, provision of public facilities such as streets, parks, open space, transportation, schools, utilities, and enhanced law enforcement and fire protection. The establishment of vested rights through a development agreement can ensure reasonable certainty, stability, and fairness in the land use approval process, provide for more efficient uses of resources, and foster cooperation between the public and private sectors in the area of land use planning.
